<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>Great books, the masterpieces of the
special branch of knowledge with which
they deal, are often very big books;
and busy men, who have not unlimited
time for reading, find it helpful to have
some one who will give them a general
summary of a famous writer's teaching,
and point out the most important passages
in which the author himself embodies
the very essence of his argument.</p>

<p>This is what Major Murray has done
for the most important work on war
that was ever written. He does not give
a mere dry summary of its contents.

He sets forth, in language so plain that
even the civilian reader or the youngest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
soldier can read it with interest, the
essence of the teaching of Clausewitz,
and he embodies in his book the most
striking passages of the original work.
He adds to each section of his subject
some useful criticisms, and at the end of
the book he sums up the effect of recent
changes on the practice of war.</p>

<p>The book is a popular manual of the
realities of war, which should be read not
only by soldiers, but by every one who
takes an intelligent interest in the great
events of our time.</p>

<p>As to the practical value of the writings
of Clausewitz, it may be well to quote
here the words of Mr. Spenser Wilkinson,
the Professor of Military History at
Oxford, from his introduction to the
original edition of Major Murray's
work:</p>

<p>"Clausewitz was a Prussian officer
who first saw fighting as a boy in 1793,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
and whose experience of war lasted until
1815, when the great war ended. He
was then thirty-five and spent the next
fifteen years in trying to clear his mind
on the subject of war, which he did by
writing a number of military histories
and a systematic treatise 'On War.'
At the age of fifty he tied his manuscripts
into a parcel, hoping to work at them
again on the conclusion of the duties
for which he was ordered from home. A
little more than a year later he died at
Breslau of cholera, and the papers, to
which he had never put the finishing
touch, were afterwards published by his
widow.</p>

<p>"Part of the value of his work is due
to the exceptional opportunities which he
enjoyed. When the war of 1806 began
he had long been the personal adjutant
of one of the Prussian princes, and an
intimate friend of Scharnhorst, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
probably the greatest of Napoleon's contemporaries.
In the period of reorganization
which followed the Peace of Tilsit he
made the acquaintance of Gneisenau,
and of almost all the officers who made
their mark in the subsequent wars of
liberation. During the years of preparation
he was Scharnhorst's assistant, first
in the Ministry of War and then on the
General Staff. During the campaign of
1812 he served with the Russian army
as a staff officer. Thus his experience
during the four years of the Wars of
Liberation was that of one who was continually
behind the scenes, always in
touch with the Governments and Generals,
and therefore better able than any one
not so favourably placed to see everything
in its proper perspective, and to follow
and appreciate the considerations which
directed the decisions both of statesmen
and of the commanders of armies. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
personal character was of the finest
mould, and his writings have the sincerity,
the absence of which makes it so
difficult to rely upon those of Napoleon.</p>

<p>"The ultimate test of the value of books
is time. When Clausewitz died, the two
books on war which were thought the
best were those of the Archduke Charles
of Austria and General Jomini. To-day
the book of Clausewitz, 'On War,' easily
holds the first place. It is the least
technical of all the great books on war;
from beginning to end it is nothing but
common sense applied to the subject,
but for that reason it is the hardest to
digest, because common sense or a man's
natural instinctive judgment on any subject
is exceedingly hard to analyse and
put into words. An exceptionally gifted
man can go through this process, but
few can follow it for any length of time
without a distinct effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
"Almost every good institution has
arisen out of the effort to provide a remedy
for some evil, but in the imperfection of
human nature nearly every institution
brings with it fresh evils, which in their
turn have to be counteracted. The
modern spirit, with its hatred of nepotism
and its belief in knowledge, has grafted
the examination system upon every form
of education from the lowest to the
highest. The British army shares in the
benefits and in the disadvantages of the
system, of which, in the case of an
officer, the danger to be guarded against
is that it tends to accustom a man to
rely rather on his memory than his
intelligence, and to lean more on other
people's thinking than on his own. Clausewitz
aimed at producing the very opposite
result. He does not offer specific solutions
of the various problems of war lest
officers, in moments when their business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
is to decide and to act, should be trying
to recall his precepts instead of using
their eyes and their wits. His purpose
rather is to enable them to understand
what war is. He believed that if a man
had accustomed himself to think of war
as it really is, had got to know the
different elements which go to make it
up, and to distinguish those that are
important from those that are comparative
trifles, he would be more likely to
know of himself what to do in a given
situation, and would be much less likely
to confuse himself by trying to remember
what some general, long since
dead, did on some occasion in which
after all the position was by no means
the same as that in which he finds
himself."</p>

<p>What is said here of the soldier actually
engaged in war, is true also even of the
onlooker who takes a patriotic interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
in the progress of a war in which his
country is involved. Unless he has a
clear idea of the real character of modern
war, and the principles on which success
or failure depend, he will be utterly
unable to grasp the significance of the
events of which he reads each day.
And it is of real importance that in time
of war every citizen should judge soundly
the course of events, for opinion influences
action, and public opinion is
made up of the ideas of the units who
compose the public. In this connection
it is well to bear in mind a point that
is often overlooked, a point on which
Clausewitz insists in a singularly convincing
passage&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;namely, the fact that
one of the main objects of a nation
waging war is to force the enemy's
population into a state of mind favourable
to submission. This fact is sufficient
proof of the importance of public opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
being well informed not only as to the
course of events, but also as to the
principles that give to these events their
real significance.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LIFE OF CLAUSEWITZ</span></h2>

<p>In an endeavour, such as the present, to
interest the British public in even the
greatest military writer, the first necessity
is to show that he was not a mere theorist
or bookworm. The wide and varied
experience which the British officer gradually
gains in so many different parts
of the world shows up the weak points
of most theories, and produces a certain
distrust of them. Also a distrust of
theory is undoubtedly one of our national
characteristics. Hence, in order to appeal
to the British officer or civilian, a writer
must be a practical soldier.</p>

<p>Such was General Clausewitz: a practical
soldier of very great experience in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the long series of wars 1793 to 1815,
and one present throughout that most
awful of all campaigns, Napoleon's Russian
campaign in 1812.</p>

<p>"General Karl von Clausewitz was
born near Magdeburg in 1780, and entered
the Prussian army as Fahnenjunker in
1792. He served in the campaigns of
1793&ndash;1794 on the Rhine. In 1801 he
entered the military school at Berlin as
an officer, and remained there till 1803.
He here attracted the notice of Scharnhorst.
In the campaign of 1806 he
served as aide-de-camp to Prince Augustus
of Prussia, was present at the battle of
Jena, and saw that awful retreat which
ended a fortnight later in the surrender
at Prentzlau. Being wounded and captured,
he was sent into France as a
prisoner till the end of the war." "On
his return (in November, 1807) he was
placed on General Scharnhorst's staff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and employed on the work then going
on for the reorganization of the Prussian
army. In 1812 Clausewitz entered the
Russian service, was employed on the
general staff, and was thus able to gain
much experience in the most gigantic of
all the struggles of his time." "In the
spring campaign of 1813 (battles of
Lutzen, Bautzen, etc.), he, as a Russian
officer, was attached to Blucher's staff;
during the winter campaign he found
employment as chief-of-the-staff to Count
Walmoden, who fought against Davoust
on the Lower Elbe, and the splendid
action of the Goerde was entirely the
result of his able dispositions. In 1815
he again entered the Prussian service,
and was chief-of-the-staff to the III.
Army Corps (Thielman), which at Ligny
formed the left of the line of battle, and
at Wavre covered the rear of Blucher's
army." "In addition to this, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
say, considerable practical training (note,
enormous and varied indeed compared
to any obtainable in the present day),
he also possessed a comprehensive and
thorough knowledge of military history,
and also an uncommonly clear perception
of general history" (Von Caemmerer).
After the Peace he was employed in a
command on the Rhine. In 1818 he
became major-general, and was made
Director of the Military School at Berlin.
Here he remained for some years. This
was the chief period of his writings. As
General von Caemmerer, in his "Development
of Strategical Science," puts it:
"This practical and experienced, and at
the same time highly cultured soldier,
feels now, in peaceful repose, as he himself
confesses, the urgent need to develop
and systematize the whole world of
thought which occupies him, yet also
resolves to keep secret till his death the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
fruit of his researches, in order that his
soul, which is thirsting for <em>Truth</em>, may
be safely and finally spared all temptations
from subordinate considerations."</p>

<p>In 1830 he was appointed Director of
Artillery at Breslau, and, having no more
time for writing, sealed up and put away
his papers, unfinished as they were. In
the same year he was appointed chief-of-the-staff
to Field-Marshal Gneisenau's
army. In the winter of that year war
with France was considered imminent,
and Clausewitz had prospects of acting
as chief of the general staff of the Commander-in-Chief
Gneisenau. He then
drew up two plans for war with France,
which bear the stamp of that practical
knowledge of war and adaptation of
means to ends which distinguish his
writings.</p>

<p>In the same year the war scare passed
away, the army of Gneisenau was disbanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and Clausewitz returned to Breslau,
where after a few days he was seized
with cholera, and died in November, 1831,
aged only 51.</p>

<p>His works were published after his
death by his widow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE INFLUENCE OF CLAUSEWITZ ON MODERN
POLICY AND WAR</span></h2>

<p>From the day of their publication until
now the influence of the writings of
Clausewitz has been steadily growing,
till to-day it is impossible to over-estimate
the extent of that influence upon modern
military and political thought, especially
in Germany. As General von Caemmerer,
in his "Development of Strategical
Science," says: "Karl von Clausewitz,
the pupil and friend of Scharnhorst and
the confidant of Gneisenau, is in Germany
generally recognized as the most prominent
theorist on war, as the real
philosopher on war, to whom our famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
victors on the more modern battlefields
owe their spiritual training."</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Moltke was "his most
distinguished pupil," and adapted the
teaching of Clausewitz to the conditions
of to-day.</p>

<p>General von der Goltz, in the introduction
to his great work, "The Nation
in Arms," thus describes the veneration
which he inspires: "A military writer
who, after Clausewitz, writes upon the
subject of war, runs the risk of being
likened to a poet who, after Goethe,
attempts a <em>Faust</em>, or, after Shakespeare,
a <em>Hamlet</em>. Everything important that
can be told about the nature of war can
be found stereotyped in the works which
that great military genius has left behind
him. Although Clausewitz has himself
described his book as being something as
yet incomplete, this remark of his must
be taken to mean that he, too, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
subject to the fate of all aspiring spirits,
and was forced to feel that all he attained
lay far beneath his ideal. For us, who
knew not what that ideal was, his labours
are a complete work. I have, accordingly,
not attempted to write anything new, or
of universal applicability about the science
of warfare, but have limited myself to
turning my attention to the military operations
of our own day." One can hardly
imagine a stronger tribute of admiration.</p>

<p>And, as Moltke was Clausewitz's most
distinguished pupil, so also are all those
trained in the school of Moltke pupils of
Clausewitz, including the most eminent
of modern German military writers, such
as General von Blume, in his "Strategy";
Von der Goltz, in his "Nation in Arms"
and "The Conduct of War," who trained
the Turkish General Staff for the campaign
of 1897 against Greece and the
battle of Pharsalia, etc.; General von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Boguslawski; General von Verdy du
Vernois, the father of the study of
Applied Tactics; General von Schlichting,
in his "Tactical and Strategical Principles
of the Present"; General Meckel, who
trained the Japanese Staff, etc., etc.</p>

<p>We all remember the telegram sent to
General Meckel by Marshal Oyama after
the battle of Liao-yang: "We hope you
are proud of your pupils."</p>

<p>Some time ago, when asked to give a
lecture at Aldershot to the officers of the
2nd Division on Clausewitz, it struck me
that it would be very interesting, anxious
as we all were then to know the causes
of the wonderful Japanese efficiency and
success, if I could obtain a pronouncement
from General Meckel how far he had
been influenced in his teaching by Clausewitz.
My friend Herr von Donat did me
the favour to write to General von Caemmerer
and ask him if he could procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
me such a pronouncement which I might
publish. General Meckel, whose death
both Japan and Germany have since had
to mourn, most kindly consented, and I
esteem it a great honour to be allowed to
quote part of his letter. He said: "I,
like every other German officer, have,
consciously or unconsciously, instructed
in the spirit of Clausewitz. Clausewitz
is the <em>founder</em> of that theory of war which
resulted from the Napoleonic. I maintain
that <em>every one</em> who nowadays either
makes or teaches war in a modern sense,
bases himself upon Clausewitz, even if
he is not conscious of it." This opinion
of General Meckel, to whose training of
the Japanese General Staff the success of
the Japanese armies must be largely
attributed, is most interesting. It is not
possible to give a stronger or more up-to-date
example of the magnitude of the
influence of Clausewitz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
In this connection I should like to
make a short quotation from "The War
in the Far East," by the <i>Times</i> military
correspondent. In his short but suggestive
chapter on "Clausewitz in Manchuria"
he says: "But as all save
one of the great battles in Manchuria
have been waged by the Japanese in
close accordance with the spirit and
almost the letter of Clausewitz's doctrine,
and as the same battles have been fought
by the Russians in absolute disregard of
them (though his works had been translated
into Russian by General Dragomiroff
long before the war), it is certainly worth
showing how reading and reflection may
profit one army, and how the neglect of
this respectable practice may ruin another."
"Clausewitz in Manchuria"!
That brings us up to date. It is a far cry
for his influence to have reached, and
triumphed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>Clausewitz wrote his book expressly for
statesmen as well as soldiers. We may
be sure, therefore, that the influence of
Clausewitz on the Continent has penetrated
the realm of policy little less widely than
the realm of war. From this thought
arise many reflections. It will be sufficient
here to suggest one. I would
suggest that we should regard every
foreign statesman, especially in Germany,
as, consciously or unconsciously, a disciple
of Clausewitz. That is to say, we
should regard him as a man who, underneath
everything else, underneath the
most pacific assurances for the present,
considers war an unalterable part of
policy. He will regard war as part of
the ordinary intercourse of nations, and
occasional warlike struggles as inevitable
as commercial struggles. He will consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
war also as an instrument of policy,
which he himself may have to use, and
to be studied accordingly. He will consider
it not as a thing merely for speeches,
but for practical use in furthering or
defending the interests of his State. He
will regard war as the means by which
some day his nation shall impose its will
upon another nation. He will be prepared
to wait and wait, to make "every
imaginable preparation," and finally to
let loose war in its most absolute and
ruthless character, war carried out with
the utmost means, the utmost energy,
and the utmost effort of a whole nation-in-arms,
determined to achieve its political
object and compel submission to
its will by force.</p>

<p>To talk to such a man of "the evils of
war," or of "the burden of armaments";
or to propose to him "disarmament" or
"reduction of armed forces," and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
forth can only appear to him as the
result of "imperfect knowledge." He
will not say so, but he will think so, and
act accordingly. To the partially instructed
opponent of such a man one can
only say, "Let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITINGS OF CLAUSEWITZ</span></h2>

<p>The writings of Clausewitz are contained
in nine volumes, published after his
death in 1831, but his fame rests chiefly
on his three volumes "On War," which
have been translated by Colonel J.&nbsp;J.
Graham (the last edition edited by Colonel
F.&nbsp;N. Maude, and published by Messrs.
Kegan Paul, London). Clausewitz calls
them "a collection of materials," "a
mass of conceptions not brought into
form," and states that he intended to
revise, and throw the whole into more
complete shape.</p>

<p>We must lament that he did not live
to complete his revision. But, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
other hand, it is perhaps possible that
this unfinished state is really an advantage,
for it leaves us free to apply his great
maxims and principles and mode of
thought to the ever-varying conditions
of the present and future, unhampered
by too complete a crystallization of his
ideas written before more modern conditions
of railways, telegraphs, and rapid
long-ranging arms of precision, etc.,
arose. It is perhaps this unfinished state
which renders Clausewitz so essentially
in touch with, and a part of, the onward
movement and evolution of military
thought. For his great aim was "the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth," without preconception or
favour, as far as he could go&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;essentially
"a realist" of war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and what better aim
can we set before ourselves?</p>

<p>As Sir Arthur Helps has so well put it
in his "Friends in Council," every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
needs a sort of central stem for his
reading and culture. I wish here to say
why I think that Clausewitz is admirably
adapted to form such a main stem in
the military culture of British officers.</p>

<p>In the first place there is a lofty sort
of tone about his writings which one
gradually realizes as one reads them, and
which I will not attempt to describe
further than by saying that they stamp
themselves as the writings of a gentleman
of fine character.</p>

<p>In the second place it is a book which
"any fellow" can read, for there is
nothing to "put one off," nothing abstruse
or mathematical or formal, no formulæ
or lines and angles and technical terms,
such as in other writers, Jomini, Hamley,
etc. Clausewitz is free from all such
pedantries, which for my part, and I
dare say for the part of many others,
often "put one off" a book, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
one instinctively feel that there was
something wrong, something unpractical
about it, which rendered it hardly worth
the sacrifice of time involved in its study.
There is in Clausewitz nothing of that
kind at all. All those lines and angles
and formulæ he dismisses in a few pages
as of little practical importance.</p>

<p>In the third place Clausewitz only
goes in for experience and the practical
facts of war. As he somewhat poetically
puts it, "The flowers of Speculation
require to be cut down low near the
ground of Experience, their proper soil."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
He is the great apostle of human nature
and character as being everything in
war. "All war supposes human weakness,
and against that it is <span class="locked">directed."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
I believe that the British officer will find
himself in sympathy with the great
thinker on war, who asserts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> "<em>Of
all military virtues Energy in the conduct
of Operations has always conduced most
to glory and success of arms</em>."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>In the fourth place, to the practical
mind will appeal his denunciation of all
elaborate plans, because <em>Time</em> is required
for all elaborate combinations, and Time
is just the one thing that an active
enemy will not give us,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and his consequent
deduction that all plans must be
of the simplest possible form. His famous
sentence, "<em>In war all things are simple,
but the simple are difficult</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> gives the
key to his writings, for to <em>overcome
those simple yet great difficulties he regards
as the art of war</em>, which can only be
done by the military virtues of perseverance,
energy, and boldness.</p>

<p>In the fifth place he does not want
men to be bookworms, for he says:</p>

<p>"<i>Theory is nothing but rational reflection</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<i>upon all the situations in which we can
be placed in war</i>."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> And we can all
reflect, without reading too many books.
Also he says: "Much reading of history
is not required for the above object.
The knowledge of a few separate battles,
<em>in their details</em>, is more useful than a
general knowledge of several campaigns.
On this account it is more useful to read
detailed narratives and journals than
regular works of <span class="locked">history."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> He wants
history in detail, not a general smattering
and a loose application thereof, which
fault he strongly denounces. And he
expressly states that the history of the
very latest war is the most useful. All
of which is very practical, and in accord
with what we feel to be true.</p>

<p>As he pictures war, "<i>the struggle
between the spiritual and moral forces</i> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
<em>both</em> sides is the centre of <span class="locked">all,"<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> and to
this aspect of the subject he gives much
more attention than Jomini and most of
Jomini's disciples. He has freed us once
for all from all formalism. The formation
of character, careful, practical, detailed
study, and thorough preparation in peace,
the simplest plans carried out with the
utmost perseverance, resolution, energy,
and boldness in war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;these are the
practical fruits of his teaching.</p>

<p>Therefore, I say again, that I do not
think that the British officer could possibly
find a more interesting or a better
guide for the main stem of his reading
than Clausewitz, nor any one that will
appeal to his practical instincts of what
is <em>True</em> half so well. I do not believe
that he could possibly do better than
with Clausewitz as main stem, and a
detailed study of the latest campaigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and modern technicalities as the up-to-date
addition required to transform knowledge
into action. I trust that every
reader of Clausewitz will agree with me
in this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE THEORY AND THE PRACTICE OF WAR</span></h2>

<p>"Moltke, the most gifted pupil of Clausewitz,"
"Moltke, who knew Clausewitz's
book well, and often liked to describe
him as the theoretical instructor." As
Chaucer would say, "What needeth
wordes more?"</p>

<p>Clausewitz has treated practically every
chief branch of strategy and tactics
(except, of course, the present-day developments
of railways, telegraphs, quick-firing
guns, smokeless powder, universal
service armies, etc.). The whole of his
bulky work "On War" is full of interesting
and sometimes eloquent and almost
poetical passages, of concentrated, pregnant,
and far-reaching thoughts on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
subject. Through all these it is, of
course, impossible to follow him in any
introduction. One can really do no more
than urge all to read Clausewitz for
themselves, to go to the fountain-head,
to the master-work itself. In the short
space to which I have restricted myself,
I propose, therefore, to concentrate on
a few of his leading ideas, reluctantly
leaving out many others which are really
almost just as good.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Theory and Practice</span></h3>

<p>One of the things for which we are
most deeply indebted to Clausewitz is
that he has shown us clearly the proper
place of theory in relation to practice.
"It should educate the mind of the
future leader in war, or, rather, guide
him in his <em>self-instruction</em>, but <em>not</em> accompany
him on to the battlefield; just as
a sensible tutor forms and enlightens the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
opening mind of a youth without therefore
keeping him in leading-strings all
his <span class="locked">life."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> Again, "In real action most
men are guided by the tact of judgment,
which hits the object more or less accurately,
according as they possess more
or less genius. This is the way in which
all great generals have acted, and therein
partly lay their greatness and their genius,
in that they always hit upon what was
right by this tact. Thus also it will
always be in <em>action</em>, and so far this tact
is amply sufficient. But when it is a
question not of acting one's self, but of
convincing others <em>in consultation</em>, then
all depends upon clear conceptions and
demonstrations and the inherent relations;
and so little progress has been
made in this respect that most deliberations
are merely a contention of words,
resting on no firm basis, and ending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
either in every one retaining his own
opinion, or in a compromise from mutual
considerations of respect, a middle course
really without any value. Clear ideas
on these matters are not, therefore,
wholly <span class="locked">useless."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>How true this is any one will admit
who reflects for a moment upon the great
diversity of opinions on almost every
subject held in our army, just because
of this want of a central theory common
to all. In the domain of tactics it is
evident that this holds good even as in
strategy, for a common central theory
of war will produce a more or less common
way of looking at things, from which
results more or less common action
towards the attainment of the common
object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rejection of Set and Geometrical Theories</span></h3>

<p>"It should educate the mind of the
future leader in war" is what Clausewitz
demands from a useful theory; but he
most expressly and unreservedly rejects
every attempt at a method "by which
definite plans for wars or campaigns are
to be given out all ready made as if from
a <span class="locked">machine."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> He mocks at Bülow's
including at first in the one term "base"
all sorts of things, like the supply of
the army, its reinforcements and equipments,
the security of its communications
with the home country, and lastly the
security of its line of retreat, and then
fixing the extent of the base, and finally
fixing an angle for the extent of that
base: "And all this was done merely
to obtain a pure geometrical result utterly
useless" (Von Caemmerer).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
For the same reason Jomini's principle
of the Inner Line does not satisfy him,
owing to its mere geometrical nature,
although he right willingly acknowledges
"that it rests on a sound foundation,
on the truth that the combat is the only
effectual means in war" (Von Caemmerer).
All such attempts at theory
seem to him therefore perfectly useless,
"because they strive to work with fixed
quantities, while in war everything is
<em>uncertain</em>, and all considerations must
reckon with all kinds of variable quantities;
because they only consider <em>material</em>
objects, while every action in war is
saturated with <em>moral</em> forces and effects;
lastly, because they deal only with the
action of <em>one</em> party, while war is a constant
reciprocal effect of <em>both</em> parties" (Von
Caemmerer).</p>

<p>"Pity the warrior," says Clausewitz,
"who is contented to crawl about in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
beggardom of rules." "Pity the theory
which sets itself in opposition to the
<span class="locked">mind"<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> (note, the moral forces).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Theory to be Practically Useful</span></h3>

<p>Clausewitz insists that a useful theory
cannot be more than a thorough knowledge
of military history and "reflection
upon all the situations in which we can
be placed in war." "What genius does
must be just the best of all rules, and
theory cannot do better than to show
just how and why it is so." "It is an
analytical investigation of the subject
which leads to exact knowledge: and if
brought to bear on the results of experience,
which in our case would be
military history, to a <em>thorough</em> familiarity
with it. If theory investigates the subjects
which constitute war; if it separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
more distinctly that which at first sight
seems amalgamated; if it explains fully
the properties of the means; if it shows
their probable effects; if it makes evident
the nature of objects; <em>if it brings
to bear all over the field of war the light
of essentially critical investigation</em>,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then
it has fulfilled the chief duties of its
province. It becomes then a guide to
him who wishes to make himself acquainted
with war from books; it lights
up the whole road for him, facilitates
his progress, educates his judgment, and
shields him from <span class="locked">error."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Knowledge must be Thorough</span></h3>

<p>This Clausewitz considers most important.
He says that "Knowledge of the
conduct of war ... <em>must pass completely
into the mind</em>, and almost cease to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
something objective." For in war "The
moral reaction, the ever-changing form
of things makes it necessary for the chief
actor to carry <em>in himself</em> the whole
mental apparatus of his knowledge, in
order that anywhere and at every pulse-beat
he may be capable of giving the
requisite decision <em>from himself</em>. Knowledge
must, by this complete assimilation
with his own mind and life, be converted
into real power."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So much for Clausewitz, therefore, as
the greatest yet the simplest and least
theoretical of theorists on war. Mark
well his comforting dictum that "Theory
is nothing but rational reflection upon
all the situations in which we can be
placed in war." That is a task which we
have all more or less attempted. Therefore
we are all more or less theorists.
The only question is that of comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
"thoroughness" in our reflections. And
it is essentially this "thoroughness" in
investigation and reflection towards which
Clausewitz helps us. Like every other
habit, the <em>habit</em> of military reflection
gradually grows with use; till, fortified
and strengthened by detailed knowledge,
it gradually becomes Power.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>The theory of war is simple, and there
is no reason why any man who chooses
to take the trouble to read and reflect
carefully on one or two of the acknowledged
best books thereon, should not
attain to a fair knowledge thereof. He
may with reasonable trouble attain to
such knowledge of the theory of war as
will enable him to follow with intelligent
appreciation the discussions of experienced
soldier or soldiers. Such knowledge as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
will prevent his misunderstanding the
experienced soldier's argument from pure
ignorance, and such knowledge as will
enable him to understand the military
reasons put forward and the military
object proposed. To the opinion of such
a man all respect will be due. Thus, and
thus only.</p>

<p>It is indeed the plain duty of all who
aspire to rule either thus to qualify themselves
to understand, or else to abstain
from interference with, the military interests
of the State.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFORT REQUIRED IN A
MODERN NATIONAL WAR</span></h2>

<p>This point is here illustrated with more
detail from Clausewitz than may seem
necessary to some, because it is precisely
the point regarding modern war which is
least understood in this country.</p>

<p>"The complete overthrow of the enemy
is the natural end of the art of war."
"As this idea must apply to both the
belligerent parties, it must follow, that
there can be no suspension in the military
act, and peace cannot take place until
one or other of the parties concerned is
completely overthrown." This is what
Clausewitz means by Absolute War, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
is war carried to its absolute and logical
conclusion with the utmost force, the
utmost effort and the utmost energy.
He then proceeds to show that war,
owing "to all the natural inertia and
friction of its parts, the whole of the
inconsistency, the vagueness and hesitation
(or timidity) of the human mind,"
usually takes a weaker or less absolute
form according to circumstances. "All
this, theory must admit, but it is its duty
to give the foremost place to the absolute
form of war, and to use that form as a
general point of direction." He then
proceeds to show that war finally took
its absolute form under Napoleon. To-day
we may say that war takes its absolute
form in the modern great national war,
which is waged by each belligerent with
the whole concentrated physical and
mental power of the nation-in-arms.</p>

<p>This requires to be gone into a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
more in detail, for it is a most important
point.</p>

<p>Clausewitz in Book VIII. approaches
this part of his subject by an historical
survey of war from the time of the
Roman Empire to that of Napoleon. He
shows how as the feudal system gradually
merged into the later monarchical States
of Europe, armies gradually became less
and less national, more and more mercenary.
Omitting this, we arrive at the
seventeenth century. He says: "The
end of the seventeenth century, the time
of Louis XIV., is to be regarded as the
point in history at which the standing
military power, such as it existed in the
eighteenth century, reached its zenith.
That military force was based on enlistment
and money. States had organized
themselves into complete unities; and
the governments, by commuting the personal
services of their subjects into money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
payments, had concentrated their whole
power in their treasuries. Through the
rapid strides in social improvements, and a
more enlightened system of government,
this power had become very great in
comparison with what it had been. France
appeared in the field with a standing army
of a couple of hundred thousand men,
and the other Powers in proportion."</p>

<p>Armies were supported out of the
Treasury, which the sovereign regarded
partly as his privy purse, at least as a
resource belonging to the Government,
and not to the people. Relations with
other States, except with respect to a few
commercial subjects, mostly concerned
only the interests of the Treasury or of
the Government, not those of the people;
at least ideas tended everywhere in that
way. The Cabinets therefore looked upon
themselves as the owners and administrators
of large estates, which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
continually seeking to increase, without
the tenants on those estates being particularly
interested in this improvement.</p>

<p>The people, therefore, who in the
Tartar invasions were everything in war,
who in the old republics and in the
Middle Ages were of great consequence,
were in the eighteenth century absolutely
nothing directly.</p>

<p>In this manner, in proportion as the
Government separated itself more from
the people, and regarded itself as the
State, war became more and more exclusively
a business of the Government,
which it carried on by means of the
money in its coffers and the idle vagabonds
it could pick up in its own and
neighbouring countries. The army was
a State property, very expensive, and not
to be lightly risked in battle. "In its
signification war was only diplomacy
somewhat intensified, a more vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
way of negotiating, in which battles and
sieges were substituted for diplomatic
notes."</p>

<p>"Plundering and devastating the
enemy's country were no longer in accordance
with the spirit of the age."
"They were justly looked upon as unnecessary
barbarity." "War, therefore,
confined itself more and more, both as
regards means and ends, to the army
itself. The army, with its fortresses and
some prepared positions, constituted a
State in a State, within which the element
of war slowly consumed itself. All Europe
rejoiced at its taking this direction, and
held it to be the necessary consequence of
the spirit of progress."</p>

<p>So think many in this country to-day.
They are only a hundred years behind
the times.</p>

<p>"The plan of a war on the part of the
State assuming the offensive in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
times consisted generally in the conquest
of one or other of the enemy's provinces;
the plan of the defender was to prevent
this. The plan of campaign was to take
one or other of the enemy's fortresses,
or to prevent one of our own being taken;
it was only when a battle became unavoidable
for this purpose that it was sought
for and fought. Whoever fought a battle
without this unavoidable necessity, from
mere innate desire of gaining a victory,
was reckoned a general with too much
daring." For armies were too precious
to be lightly risked. "Winter quarters,
in which the mutual relations of the two
parties almost entirely ceased, formed a
distinct limit to the activity which was
considered to belong to one campaign."
"As long as war was universally conducted
in this manner, all was considered
to be in the most regular order." "Thus
there was eminence and perfection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
every kind, and even Field-Marshal Daun,
to whom it was chiefly owing that
Frederick the Great completely attained
his object, and Maria Theresa completely
failed in hers, notwithstanding that could
still pass for a great general."</p>

<p>Beyond this stage of military thought,
many in this country have not yet
advanced.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"Thus matters stood when the French
Revolution broke out; Austria and
Prussia tried their diplomatic art of war;
this very soon proved insufficient. Whilst,
according to the usual way of seeing
things, all hopes were placed on a very
limited military force in 1793, such a
force as no one had any conception of
made its appearance. War had suddenly
become again an affair of the people,
and that of a people numbering thirty
millions, every one of whom regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
himself as a citizen of the State." "<em>By
this participation of the people in the
war</em>, instead of a cabinet and an army,
a whole nation with its natural weight
came into the scale. Henceforth the
means available&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the efforts which might
be called forth&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;had no longer any
definite limits; the energy with which
the war itself might be conducted had
no longer any counterpoise, and consequently
the danger to the adversary had
risen to the extreme."</p>

<p>If only our politicians could learn this
old lesson of the French Revolution!
For many, too many, of them appear
to derive their ideas of war to-day from
some dim reminiscent recollections of
school histories of the wars in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>To continue: "After all this was
perfected by the hand of Bonaparte, this
military power based on the strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the whole nation, marched over Europe,
smashing everything in pieces so surely
and certainly, that where it only encountered
the old-fashioned armies the
result was not doubtful for a moment.</p>

<p>"A reaction, however, awoke in due
time. In Spain the war became of itself
an affair of the people." In Austria.
In Russia. "In Germany Prussia rose
up the first, made the war a national
cause, and without either money or
credit, and with a population reduced
one-half, took the field with an army
twice as strong as in 1806. The rest of
Germany followed the example of Prussia
sooner or later." "Thus it was that
Germany and Russia, in the years 1813
and 1814, appeared against France with
about a million of men."</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances the energy
thrown into the conduct of war was
quite different." "In eight months the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
theatre of war was removed from the
Oder to the Seine. Proud Paris had to
bow its head for the first time; and the
redoubtable Bonaparte lay fettered on
the ground."</p>

<p>"Therefore, since the time of Bonaparte,
war, through being, first on one
side, then again on the other, an affair
of the whole nation, has assumed quite
a new nature, or rather it has approached
much nearer to its real nature, to its
absolute perfection. The means then
called forth had no visible limit, the limit
losing itself in the energy and enthusiasm
of the Government and its subjects. By
the extent of the means, and the wide
field of possible results, as well as by the
powerful excitement of feeling which
prevailed, energy in the conduct of war
was immensely increased; the object
of its action was the downfall of the foe;
and not until the enemy lay powerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
on the ground was it supposed to be
possible to stop, or to come to any understanding
with regard to the mutual
objects of the contest.</p>

<p>"Thus, therefore the element of war,
freed from all conventional restrictions,
broke loose with all its natural force.
The cause was the participation of the
people in this great affair of State, and
this participation arose partly from the
effects of the French Revolution on the
internal affairs of other countries, partly
from the threatening attitude of the
French towards all nations.</p>

<p>"Now, whether this will be the case
always in future, whether all wars hereafter
in Europe will be carried on with
the whole power of the States, and,
consequently, <em>will only take place on
account of great interests closely affecting
the people</em>, would be a difficult point to
settle. But every one will agree with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
that, at least, <em>Whenever great interests
are in dispute</em>, mutual hostility will discharge
itself in the same manner as it
has done in our times."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>This is so true, that every war since
the days of Clausewitz has made its
truth more apparent. Since he wrote,
the participation of the people in war
has become, not a revolutionary fact,
but an organized fact, an ordinary fact
in the everyday life of nations. To-day
every State except Great Britain, securely
based on the system of the universal
training of its sons to arms, stands ready
to defend its interests with the whole
concentrated power, physical, intellectual,
and material, of its whole manhood.
Consequently, European war, as Clausewitz
foresaw, "will only take place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
account of great interests closely affecting
the people." The character of such war
will be absolute, the object of its action
will be the downfall of the foe, and not
till the foe (be it Great Britain or not)
lies powerless on the ground will it be
supposed possible to stop. In the prosecution
of such a national war the means
available, the energy and the effort
called forth, will be without limits. Such
must be the conflicts of nations-in-arms.</p>

<p>Yet, even now, so many years after
Clausewitz wrote, in the hope, as he
himself stated, "to iron out many creases
in the heads of strategists and statesmen,"
the great transformation in the character
of modern war, due to the participation of
the people therein, has not yet been
adequately realized by many men in this
country <em>who ought to know</em>. It is earnestly
to be hoped that they will endeavour to
adjust their minds, as regards war, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the fact that we are living, not in the
eighteenth century, but in the twentieth,
and that they will consider that war
has once for all become an affair of the
people, that our opponents will be a
people-in-arms, using the uttermost means
of their whole manhood to crush us, and
that disaster can only be prevented by a
like utmost effort on our part, by an
effort regardless of everything except
self-preservation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">PUBLIC OPINION IN WAR</span></h2>

<p>"War belongs, not to the province of
arts and sciences, but to the province
of social life. It is a conflict of great
interests which is settled by bloodshed,
and only in that respect is it different
from others. It would be better, instead
of comparing it with any art, to liken
it to trade, which is also a conflict of
human interests and activities; and it is
still more like state policy, which again,
on its part, may be looked upon as a
kind of trade on a great scale. Besides,
state policy is the womb in which war is
developed, in which its outlines lie hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in a rudimentary state, like the qualities
of living creatures in their <span class="locked">germs."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span></p>

<p>These conflicts of interest can bring
about gradually such a state of feeling
that "even the most civilized nations
may burn with passionate hatred of each
other." It is an unpleasant fact for
the philosopher, for the social reformer,
to contemplate, but history repeats and
repeats the lesson. Still more, "It is
quite possible for such a state of feeling
to exist between two States that a very
trifling political motive for war may
produce an effect quite disproportionate&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in
fact, a perfect explosion."</p>

<p>"War is a wonderful trinity, composed
of the original violence of its elements&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;hatred
and animosity&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which may be
looked upon as blind instinct; of the
play of probabilities and chance, which
make it a free activity of the soul; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of the subordinate nature of a political
instrument, by which it belongs purely
to the reason.</p>

<p>"The first of these three phases concerns
more the people; the second, more
the general and his army; the third
more the Government. <em>The passions
which break forth in war must already
have a latent existence in the peoples.</em></p>

<p>"These three tendencies are deeply
rooted in the nature of the subject. A
theory which would leave any one of
them out of account would immediately
become involved in such a contradiction
with the reality, that it might be regarded
as destroyed at once by that <span class="locked">alone."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p>Clausewitz is the great thinker, the
great realist, the great philosopher of
war. His aim was, free from all bias,
to get at <em>the truth of things</em>. His view
of war as a social act, as part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
intercourse of nations, so that occasional
warlike struggles can no more be avoided
than occasional commercial struggles, is
a view which requires to be most carefully
pondered over by every statesman.
It is based upon the essential fundamental
characteristics of human nature, which
do not alter. It is not to be lightly set
aside by declamation about the blessings
of peace, the evils of war, the burden of
armaments, and such-like sophistries. To
submit without a struggle to injustice
or to the destruction of one's vital
interests is not in passionate human
nature. Nor will it ever be in the nature
of a virile people. It is indeed to be
most sincerely hoped that <em>arbitration</em> will
be resorted to more and more as a means
of peacefully settling all non-vital causes
of dispute. But arbitration has its limits.
For <em>no great nation will ever submit to
arbitration any interest that it regards as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
absolutely vital</em>. The view of war, therefore,
as a social act, as part of the intercourse
of nations, with all that it implies,
appears to be the only one which a statesman,
however much he may regret the
fact, can take. It has, therefore, been
brought forward here at once, as it
underlies the whole subject and is essential
to all clear thought thereon.</p>

<p>So much for the influence of Public
Opinion in producing war. Now for its
influence in and during war.</p>

<p>"There are three principal objects in
carrying on war," says Clausewitz.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">"(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;<span class="in1">To conquer and destroy the
enemy's armed force.</span></p>

<p class="hang">"(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;<span class="in1">To get possession of the material
elements of aggression, and of the
other sources of existence of the
hostile army.</span></p>

<p class="hang">"(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;<span class="in1"><em>To gain Public Opinion.</em></span><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
"To attain the first of these objects,
the chief operation must be directed
against the enemy's principal army, for
it must be beaten before we can follow
up the other two objects with success.</p>

<p>"In order to seize the material forces,
operations are directed against those
points at which those resources are chiefly
concentrated: principal towns, magazines,
great fortresses. On the road to
these the enemy's principal force, or a
considerable part of his army, will be
encountered.</p>

<p>"Public Opinion is ultimately gained
by great victories, and by the possession
of the enemy's <span class="locked">capital."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>This almost prophetic (as it was in his
day) recognition by Clausewitz of the
vast importance of gaining Public Opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
<em>as one of the three great aims in war</em>, is
fundamental. It is just one of those
instances of his rare insight into the
principles and development of modern
national war which make his book of
such great and enduring value to us.
For since his day Europe has become
organized into great industrial nations,
democracy and popular passion have become
more and more a force to be reckoned
with, and the gaining and preserving of
Public Opinion in war has become more
and more important. It has, in fact,
become the statesman's chief business
during a great modern national war. It
has become necessary for him to study
intently war in its relation to industry,
and to the industrial millions over whom
he presides, or over whom he may
preside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>(1) In the time of Clausewitz we in
Britain were a nation of 18,000,000,
practically self-supporting, and governed
by an aristocracy. To-day we are a
crowded nation of 43,000,000 dependent
upon over-sea sources for three-fourths
of our food, for our raw materials, for
our trade, for our staying power, <em>and</em> we
are governed by a democracy. In a
modern democratic State it will only be
possible to carry on the most just and
unavoidable war so long as the hardships
brought on the democracy by the war
do not become intolerable. To prevent
these hardships from thus becoming intolerable
to the people, to Public Opinion,
will be the task of the modern statesman
during war, and this can only be done by
wise prevision and timely preparation.
<em>It requires the internal organization of
the Industrial State for war.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
It appears to the <em>writer</em> that internal
organization can be subdivided as
<span class="locked">follows:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>I. An adequate gold reserve.</p>

<p>II. The protection of our ships carrying
raw material, food, and exports
during their passage on the high seas
from the places of origin to the consumers:
(A) by the few available cruisers
which could be spared from the fighting
fleets, assisted by a thoroughly well
thought out and prepared scheme of
national indemnity (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> Blue Book thereon);
(B) by insuring the distribution to
the consumers of food and raw material,
after it has arrived in the country, by
preparing a thorough organization which
would deal with the blocking of any of
the principal ports of arrival, and by
guarding the vulnerable points of our
internal lines of communications to and
from the shipping centres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
III. Organization of Poor Law system
to bring immediate relief by selling at
peace price food to those unable to pay
war prices owing to (A) normal poverty
(7,000,000 to 8,000,000 souls), (B) out-of-works,
due to effect of war on trade.</p>

<p>Work and wages the State <em>must</em> guarantee
during modern war, and before the
State <em>can</em> guarantee these, it is absolutely
necessary that it should satisfy itself
that the above preparations are actually
<em>in being</em>. This pre-supposes a more
earnest study of the industrial effects of
a great national war than has yet been
given to the subject by our political
leaders. For in the warfare of the
present and future the importance of
gaining and preserving Public Opinion,
as pointed out by Clausewitz, cannot be
over-estimated. It is as fundamentally
important <em>to safeguard our own Public
Opinion as it is to attack, weaken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
gain over that of the enemy</em>. This has
not yet passed the stage of thought.
But good thoughts are no better than
good dreams unless they be put into
action. We are waiting for the statesman
to DO it. There is no great difficulty.</p>

<p>(2) In arousing the national spirit to
the requisite height of patriotic self-denial
and self-sacrifice, in elevating,
preserving, and safe-guarding Public
Opinion during a great national struggle,
much may be hoped for from the patriotism
of our Press. Only in fairness to
those whose patriotism is self-originating
and spontaneous, it must be made compulsory
upon <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span>, so that no journal
may suffer loss of circulation or pecuniary
injury thereby.</p>

<p>(3) There lies a practical task immediately
to the hand of our statesmen
if they will seriously set themselves to
the task of improving the <em>moral</em> of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
nation by reforming our education <em>curriculum</em>,
on the leading principle that the
moral is to the physical as three to one
in life, and that therefore character-building
must be its chief aim. Then
they will do much towards strengthening
us for war, towards carrying out Clausewitz's
idea of the gaining and preserving
of our Public Opinion in War.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE NATURE OF WAR</span></h2>

<p>"It is necessary for us to commence
with a glance at the nature of the whole,
because it is particularly necessary that,
in the consideration of any of the parts,
the whole should be kept constantly in
view. We shall not enter into any of
the abstruse definitions of war used by
Publicists. We shall keep to the element
of the thing itself, to a duel. War is
nothing but a duel on an extensive scale.
If we would conceive as a unit the
countless numbers of duels which make
up a war, we shall do so best by supposing
two wrestlers. Each strives by physical
force to throw his adversary, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to render him incapable of further resistance.</p>

<p>"Violence arms itself with the inventions
of arts and science in order to
contend against violence. Self-imposed
restrictions, almost imperceptible, and
<em>hardly worth mentioning</em>, termed <i>usages
of International Law</i>, accompany it without
essentially impairing its power.</p>

<p>"Violence, that is to say physical
force, is therefore <em>the Means</em>; the compulsory
submission of the enemy to our
will is the ultimate <em>object</em>. In order to
attain this object fully the enemy must
first be disarmed: and this is, correctly
speaking, the real aim of hostilities in
<span class="locked">theory."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>Now, "philanthropists may easily imagine
that there is a skilful method of disarming
and overcoming an adversary without
causing great bloodshed, and that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
is the proper tendency of the art of war.
However plausible this may appear, <em>still
it is an error which must be extirpated</em>,
for in such dangerous things as war <em>the
errors which proceed from a spirit of
benevolence are just the worst</em>. As the
use of physical power to the utmost
extent by no means excludes the co-operation
of the intelligence, it follows
that <em>he who uses force unsparingly without
reference to the quantity of bloodshed</em>,
<span class="smcap smaller">MUST</span> <em>obtain a superiority if his adversary
does not act likewise</em>." "To introduce
into the philosophy of war itself a principle
of moderation would be an absurdity."
"We therefore repeat our proposition,
that <em>War is an act of violence which in
its application knows no bounds</em>."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Political Nature of War</span></h3>

<p>In endeavouring briefly to describe
Clausewitz's method of looking at war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
one is continually confronted by the
difficulty of selecting a few leading ideas
out of so many profound thoughts and
pregnant passages. However, a selection
must be made.</p>

<p>I assign the first place to his conception
of war as a part of policy, because that
is fundamentally necessary to understand
his practical way of looking at
things. This point of view is as necessary
for the strategist as for the statesman,
indeed for every man who would understand
the nature of war. For otherwise
it is impossible to understand the military
conduct of many campaigns and battles,
in which the political outweighed the
military influence, and led to action
incomprehensible almost from a purely
military point of view. History is full
of such examples.</p>

<p>Clausewitz clearly lays down: "<em>War
is only a continuation of State policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
by other means.</em> This point of view being
adhered to will introduce much more
unity into the consideration of the subject,
and things will be more easily
disentangled from each <span class="locked">other."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> "It is
only thus that we can obtain a clear
conception of war, for the political view
is the <em>object</em>, war is the <em>means</em>, and the
means must always include the object
in our conception." "Each (nation or
government) strives by physical force to
compel the other to submit to its <span class="locked">will."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the great importance of this
point of view, so little understood in this
country, I have devoted the next chapter
to it alone, so as to bring out Clausewitz's
view more in detail. We can, therefore,
pass on for the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Culminating Point of Victory</span></h3>

<p>Secondly, I select his doctrine of the
culminating point of victory, because
that is essential in order to understand
his division of all wars into two classes,
according to how far the attack is likely
to be able to extend into the hostile
country before reaching its culminating
point, where reaction may set <span class="locked">in.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>"The conqueror in a war is not always
in a condition to subdue his adversary
completely. Often, in fact almost <em>universally,
there is a culminating point of
victory</em>. Experience shows this <span class="locked">sufficiently."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>
As the attack or invasion
progresses it becomes weaker even from
its successes, from sieges or corps left
to observe fortified places, from the
troops required to guard the territory
gained, and the lengthening line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
communications, from the fact that we
are removing further from our resource
while the enemy is falling back upon and
drawing nearer to his, from the danger
of other States joining in to prevent the
utter destruction of the defeated nation,
from the rousing of the whole nation in
extremity to save themselves by a people's
war, from the slackening of effort in the
victorious army itself, etc., etc. Leoben,
Friedland, Austerlitz, Moscow, are instances
of such a culminating point, and
probably in the late Russo-Japanese war
Harbin would have proved so, too, if
peace had not intervened.</p>

<p>Clausewitz continues: "It is necessary
to know how far it (our preponderance)
will reach, in order not to go
beyond that point and, instead of fresh
advantage, reap disaster." He defines
it as "<em>The point at which the offensive
changes into the defensive</em>," and says, "to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
overstep this point is more than simply
a useless expenditure of power yielding
no further results, it is a <em>destructive</em> step
which causes reaction, and the reaction
is, according to all experience, productive
of most disproportionate <span class="locked">effects."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> The
reader will find it an interesting exercise
to search for this culminating point of
victory in historical campaigns, and mark
the result where it has been overstepped
and where it has not been overstepped.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Two Classes of Wars</span></h3>

<p>From this consideration of the culminating
point of victory follow the two
classes into which Clausewitz divides all
wars.</p>

<p>"The two kinds of war are, first, those
in which the object is the complete <em>overthrow
of the enemy</em>, whether it be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
we aim at his destruction politically, or
merely at disarming him and forcing
him to conclude peace on our terms; and,
<em>next</em>, those in which our aim is merely
to make some conquests on the frontiers
of his country, either for the purpose
of retaining them permanently, or of
turning them to account as matters for
exchange in the settlement of <span class="locked">Peace."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>

<p>All wars, therefore, are wars for the
complete destruction of the enemy, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>
"unlimited object," or wars with a
"limited object." In the plan of a war
it is necessary to settle which it is to be
in accordance with our powers and
resources of attack compared with the
enemy's resources for defence, and where
our culminating point of victory is likely
to be, on this side of the enemy's capital
or beyond it. If the former&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then the
plan should be one with a "limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
object," such as the Crimea, Manchuria,
etc.; if the latter&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;then the plan should
aim at the enemy's total destruction,
such as most of Napoleon's campaigns, or
the Allies in 1813, 1814, 1815, or as
1866, or 1870. As Clausewitz says:
"<em>Now, the first, the grandest, and most
decisive act of judgment which the statesman
and general exercises, is rightly to
understand in this respect the war in
which he engages</em>, not to take it for something
or to wish to make of it something
which, by the nature of its relations, it
is impossible for it to be. <em>This, therefore,
is the first and most comprehensive of all
strategical questions.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>In Clausewitz's two plans for war
with France in <span class="locked">1831,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> this difference is
plain. In the first plan, he considered
Prussia, Austria, the German Confederation,
and Great Britain united as allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
against France,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and with this great
superiority of numbers he plans an attack
by two armies, each of 300,000 men,
one marching on Paris from Belgium,
one on Orleans from the Upper Rhine.
In the second plan the political conditions
had meanwhile changed; Austria
and Great Britain were doubtful, and
Clausewitz held it accordingly dubious
if Prussia and the German Confederation
alone could appear before Paris in sufficient
strength to guarantee victory in a
decisive battle, and with which it would
be permissible to venture even beyond
Paris. So he proposed to limit the object
to the conquest of Belgium, and to
attack the French vigorously the moment
they entered that country.</p>

<p>Which strict limitation of the object
within the means available to attain it is
characteristic of Clausewitz's practical
way of looking at things. In each plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
however, a vigorous offensive aiming at
a decisive victory was to be adopted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preparation for War</span></h3>

<p>The third place, in respect to its present-day
importance, I assign to Clausewitz's
clear statement <span class="locked">that&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>"If we have clearly understood the
result of our reflections, then the activities
belonging to war divide themselves into
two principal classes, into such as are
only <em>preparations for war</em> and into <em>the
war itself</em>. This distinction must also be
made in theory."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more clearly stated
than this, or place in greater honour
peace preparations. Like his doctrine
of the importance of gaining public
opinion in war, it is one of those almost
prophetic utterances which make Clausewitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the germ of modern military evolution.</p>

<p>Clausewitz, unlike Jomini who did not,
foresaw to a certain extent (probably
owing to his employment in organizing
the new Prussian short-service army
after 1806) the nation-in-arms of the
present day. And, since his time, the
greater the forces which have to be prepared,
the greater has become the value
of preparation for war. It has been
continually growing, till to-day it has
obtained such overwhelming importance
that one may almost say that a modern
war is practically (or nearly so) decided
<em>before</em> war breaks out, according to which
nation has made the greatest and most
thorough peace preparations.</p>

<p>Clausewitz elsewhere speaks of "every
imaginable preparation." We may nowadays
almost go so far as to say that
preparation is war, and that that nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
which is beaten in preparation is already
beaten <span class="smcap smaller">BEFORE</span> the war breaks out.</p>

<p>A failure to understand this fact is a
fundamental error at the root of the idea
of war as held by civilians, for many of
them think that speeches are a substitute
for preparations.</p>

<p>It is plain that these three ideas of
Clausewitz regarding the nature of war,
its political nature, the distinction between
wars with an unlimited object
and a limited object, and preparations in
peace-time, are as much matters for the
statesman as for the soldier, and require
study and reflection on the part of the
former as much as on the part of the
latter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Friction in War</span></h3>

<p>I place friction here before the more
detailed consideration of actual war, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
war in itself, because it is that which
distinguishes war on paper from real
war, the statesman's and soldier's part
from the part of the soldier only, and is
therefore to be fitly treated midway
between the two.</p>

<p>Friction in war is one of Clausewitz's
most characteristic ideas. He always
looks at everything from that point of
view, and as friction and the fog of war,
and their influence on human nature
will always be the chief characteristic
of real war as distinguished from theoretical
war or war on paper, it is chiefly
this habit or mode of thought which
makes his writings of such great and
permanent value. It is also a habit
which we ought sedulously to cultivate
in ourselves.</p>

<p>"<em>In war everything is very simple, but
the simplest thing is difficult</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> runs his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
famous saying. Why is the simplest
thing difficult? Because of the friction
of war. And how can that friction be
minimized? Only by force of character,
and the military virtues of discipline,
perseverance, resolution, energy, and boldness.
Hence the great emphasis which
he always and everywhere lays upon
character and these military virtues as
the deciding factors in war.</p>

<p>"<em>Friction is the only conception which
in a general way corresponds to that which
distinguishes real war from war on paper</em>,"
he says. Each individual of the army
"keeps up his own friction in all directions."
"The danger which war brings
with it, the bodily exertions which it
requires, augment this evil so much
that they may be regarded as the greatest
causes of <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> "<em>This enormous friction
is everywhere brought into contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
chance</em>, and thus facts take place upon
which it was impossible to calculate, their
chief origin being chance. As an instance
of one such chance take the weather.
Here the fog prevents the enemy from
being discovered in time,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a battery from
firing, or a report from reaching the
general. The rain (mud) prevents a
battalion from arriving,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or the cavalry
from charging effectively, because it had
stuck fast in the heavy ground." And
so on. Consider for examples the foggy
mornings of Jena or Austerlitz, of Eylau,
the Katzbach, Grosbeeren, Dennewitz,
Pultusk, Dresden, Sadowa; or the mud
of Poland, the snow of Russia, or, latest,
the mud of Manchuria.</p>

<p>"<em>Activity in war is movement in a
resistant medium.</em>" "<em>The knowledge of
friction is a chief part of that so often
talked of experience in war</em>, which is
required in a good general." "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
therefore this friction which makes that
which appears easy in war so difficult in
<span class="locked">reality."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> In considering any situation
in war we must therefore always add to
the known circumstances&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;friction.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">War Itself</span></h3>

<p>In Clausewitz's way of looking at war
itself I assign at once the first place to
his doctrine, "<em>The destruction of the
enemy's military force is the leading
principle of war</em>, and for the whole chapter
of positive action <em>the direct way to the
aim</em>."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> This dictum, repeated in many
different forms, underlies his whole conception
of war. All the old theoretical
ideas about threatening by man&oelig;uvring,
conquering by man&oelig;uvring, forcing the
enemy to retreat by man&oelig;uvring, and
so forth, in which his predecessors entangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
strategy, and from which even the
Archduke Charles and Jomini had not
completely freed themselves, he brushes
aside by "our assertion is that <span class="smcap smaller">ONLY</span>
great tactical results can lead to great
strategical <span class="locked">results."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> Thus he leads and
concentrates our thoughts in strategy on
the central idea of victory in battle, and
frees us once for all from the obscuring
veil of lines and angles and geometrical
forms by which other writers have hidden
that truth. "Philanthropists may easily
imagine that there is a skilful method of
overcoming and disarming an adversary
without causing great bloodshed, and
that this is the proper tendency of the
art of war. However plausible this may
appear, <em>it is an error which must be
extirpated</em>, for, in such dangerous things
as war, <em>the errors which spring from a
spirit of benevolence are just the worst</em>."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
For "he who uses force unsparingly
without reference to the quantity of
bloodshed, <em>must</em> obtain the superiority if
his adversary does not act likewise."
And the "worst of all errors in wars" is
still the idea of war too commonly held
by civilians in this country, as witness
the outcries which greeted every loss
during the South African war, which
shows how much Clausewitz is needed as
a tonic to brace their minds to the
reality.</p>

<p>"War is an act of violence which in its
application knows <span class="smcap smaller">NO</span> bounds." "Let
us not hear of generals who conquer
without bloodshed; if a bloody slaughter
be a horrible sight, then that is a ground
for paying more respect to war (for avoiding
unnecessary war), but not for making
the sword we wear blunt and blunter by
degrees from feelings of humanity, till
some one steps in with a sword that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
sharp, and lops off the arm from our
body."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Simple Plans</span></h3>

<p>The second place I assign to his doctrine
of <em>the simplest plans</em>, because time is
required for the completion of complicated
evolutions, but "a bold, courageous,
resolute enemy will not let us have <em>time</em>
for wide-reaching skilful <span class="locked">combination."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>
"By this it appears to us that the advantage
of simple and direct results over
those that are complicated is conclusively
shown."</p>

<p>"We must not lift the arm too far for
the room given to strike," or the opponent
will get his thrust in first.</p>

<p>"Whenever this is the case, we must
ourselves choose the shorter." "Therefore,
far from making it our aim to gain
upon the enemy by complicated plans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
<em>we must always rather endeavour to be
beforehand with him by the simplest and
shortest</em>."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strategic Lines</span></h3>

<p>The salient and re-entrant frontiers, the
subtle distinctions between the numerous
kinds of strategic lines, and lines of
operation, and lines of man&oelig;uvre, etc.,
etc., etc., which in Jomini and his predecessors
and followers play so great, so
pedantic, and so confusing a part,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for
these Clausewitz has little respect. In
his chapter on "The Geometrical <span class="locked">Element,"<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>
he says, "We therefore do not
hesitate to regard it as an established
truth that <em>in strategy more depends upon
the number and magnitude of the victorious
battles than on the form of the great lines
by which they are connected</em>."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
he does not altogether leave out such
considerations, but the above sentence
shows how he regards them as only of
minor importance. He therefore frees
us from a great deal of pedantry, and
takes us back to the heart of things.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Friction</span></h3>

<p class="in0">has been already dealt with, so no more
need be said here, except about its
components.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Danger</span></h3>

<p>"An ordinary character never attains
to complete coolness" in danger. "Danger
in war belongs to its friction, and a
correct idea of it is necessary for truth
of perception, and therefore it is brought
under notice <span class="locked">here."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bodily Exertion</span></h3>

<p>Clausewitz says that bodily exertion
and fatigue in war "put fetters on the
action of the mind, and wear out in
secret the powers of the soul." "Like
danger, they belong to the fundamental
causes of <span class="locked">friction."<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span></p>

<p>To one who, like Clausewitz, had seen
the retreat from Moscow, the awful
passage of the Beresina, and the battle
of the nations round Leipzig, bodily
exertion could not be overlooked. Had
he not seen bodily exertion and hardship
break up the Grand Army into a small
horde of stragglers, and destroy the army
of Kutusoff in almost an equal measure,
in 1812, as well as practically ruin the
spirit, and largely break up the great
army of Napoleon in 1813?</p>

<p>As for the effects of bodily exertion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the mind, purpose, and resolution of the
general, compare Benningsen at Eylau
after thirty-six hours in the saddle, or
Napoleon at Dresden, by which he lost
all the results of his victory.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Information in War</span></h3>

<p>"<em>The foundation of all our ideas and
actions</em>," but "in a few words, <em>most
reports are false</em>." "When in the thick
of war itself one report follows hard upon
the heels of another, it is fortunate if
these reports in contradicting each other
show a certain balance of probability."
In another passage, in order to illustrate
this perpetual uncertainty under which
all decisions in war have to be made, he
compares two opposing commanders to
two men fighting in a dark room and
groping uncertainly for one another.</p>

<p>"These things which as elements meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
together in the atmosphere of war and
make it a <em>resistant medium for every
activity</em>, we have designated danger, bodily
exertion, information, and <span class="locked">friction."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> He
never loses sight of this; it pervades
everything he writes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Moral and Physical</span></h3>

<p>"And therefore the most of the subjects
which we shall go through in this book
are composed <em>half of physical, half of
moral causes and effects</em>, and we might
say that the physical are almost no more
than the wooden handle, whilst the
moral are the noble metal, the real bright
polished <span class="locked">weapon."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> Pages might be
filled with extracts showing his opinion
that the moral is everything in war, but
the reader is already convinced of that.
Compare Napoleon's in war, "The moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
is to the physical as three to one."
Clausewitz regards all military questions
from this point. His psychological attitude
is what chiefly characterizes Clausewitz
from all writers who came before
him, and which makes his deductions so
realistic, so interesting and so valuable
for all who come after him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tension and Rest in War</span></h3>

<p>In order not to weary the reader I will
bring this chapter to a conclusion with
one or two extracts relating to "tension
and rest; the suspension of the act in
warfare." This is explanatory of those
frequent halts which take place in a
campaign, which appear at first sight
contradictory to the absolute theory of
war. These halts are due to many
causes, such as preparations, exhaustion,
uncertainty, irresolution, friction, waiting
for reinforcements, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
In this connection one must remember
that war is "a chain of battles all strung
together, one of which always brings on
another." But they seldom follow each
other immediately; there is usually a
certain pause between. As soon as one
battle is gained, strategy makes new
combinations in accordance with the
altered circumstances to win the next.
Whilst these new combinations are being
developed, or perhaps considered, there
may be a greater or less suspension of the
act, a longer or shorter halt in the forward
movement. Then another spring forward.
Clausewitz has a great many
interesting things to say on this <span class="locked">subject.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<p>"If there is a suspension of the act
in war, that is to say, if neither party
for the moment wills anything positive,
there is <em>rest</em>, and for the moment equilibrium....
As soon as ever one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
parties proposes to himself a new positive
object, and commences active steps towards
it, even if it is only by preparations,
and as soon as the enemy opposes this,
there is <em>tension</em> of the powers; this lasts
until the decision takes place.... This
decision, the foundation of which lies
always in the battle-combinations which
are made on each side, ... is followed by
a movement in one or other direction."</p>

<p>"It may so happen that both parties,
at one and the same time, not only feel
themselves too weak to attack, but are so
in reality."</p>

<p>"Wild as is the nature of war it still
wears the claims of human weakness, and
the contradiction we see here, that man
seeks and creates dangers which he fears
at the same time, will astonish no one."</p>

<p>"If we cast a glance at military history
in general, there we find so much the
opposite of an incessant advance towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the aim, that <em>standing still</em> and <em>doing
nothing</em> is quite plainly the <em>normal condition</em>
of an army in the midst of war,
<em>acting</em> the <em>exception</em>. This must almost
raise a doubt as to the correctness of our
conception. But if military history has
this effect by the great body of its events,
so also the latest series of wars redeem
the view. The war of the French Revolution
shows only too plainly its reality,
and only proves too plainly its necessity.
In that war, and especially in the campaigns
of Bonaparte, the conduct of war
attained to that unlimited degree of
energy which we have represented as the
natural law of the element. This degree
is therefore possible, and if it is possible
then it is necessary."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>(1) "Hardly worth mentioning"! So
that is how Clausewitz regards International<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Law, Clausewitz to whom in
Germany "our most famous victors on
the more modern battlefields owe their
spiritual training," and on whom "everybody
who to-day either makes or teaches
modern war bases himself, even if he is
not conscious of it." And we must
regard nearly every foreign statesman as,
consciously or unconsciously, a disciple
of Clausewitz. It is, therefore, high time
that we should cease to pin our faith on
International Law, or think that it can
in any way protect us, if we neglect
strongly to protect ourselves. Power and
expediency are the only rules that the
practical politicians of foreign countries
recognize, and the only question they ask
themselves is, "Have we got sufficient
power to do this," and if so, "Is it
expedient to do it?"</p>

<p>(2) Treaties, too, what reliance can we
place upon them for any length of time?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
None whatever. For treaties are only
considered binding as long as the interests
of <em>both</em> contracting parties remain the
same. Directly circumstances change,
and they change constantly, the most
solemn treaties are torn up, as Russia
tore up the Treaty of Paris, or as Austria
tore up the Treaty of Berlin. All history
is full of torn-up treaties. And as it has
been so it will be. The European waste-paper
basket is the place to which all
treaties eventually find their way, and a
thing which can any day be thrown into
a waste-paper basket is, indeed, a poor
thing on which to hang our national
safety. Only in ourselves can we trust.
Therefore no treaties at present existing
should be allowed in any way to alter
or lessen our preparations to enable us
to fight <em>alone</em> when necessary.</p>

<p>(3) It cannot be too often repeated,
or too much insisted on, that the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
or failure of a State policy is dependent
upon the amount of armed force behind
it. For upon the amount of armed force
behind a policy depends the greater or
less amount of resistance, of friction,
which that policy will meet with on the
part of other nations. The prestige of a
nation depends upon the general belief in
its strength. The less its prestige, the
more it will be checked and foiled by its
rivals, till at last perhaps it is goaded
into a war which would have been prevented
if its prestige, or armed force, had
been greater. On the other hand, the
greater its prestige, its armed force, the
more reasonable and inclined to a fair
compromise are its rivals found. So that
the greater the prestige, the armed force,
of our nation is, the more likely is it
that all our negotiations will be settled
by peaceful compromise, and the longer
we shall enjoy peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Therefore, under this consideration,
those who would reduce our national
forces are deeply mistaken, for such
action would imperil our prestige, imperil
our negotiations, imperil our peace, and
perhaps lead eventually to a war that we
might otherwise have avoided. Therefore
no such deeply mistaken economy
for us. A few hundred thousand pounds
saved would be dear economy indeed if
it led, as well it might, to the payment
before many years of a War Indemnity
of £800,000,000 or so. Better the evils
we know than the far greater evils we
know not of.</p>

<p>(4) Surprise in war is what we have
to fear. There are two sorts of national
surprise that we must consider. These
are (A) the <em>surprise by actual hostilities</em>
taking place before the actual declaration
of war, such as the Japanese surprise and
practical destruction of the fighting force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur;
(B) the <em>surprise by superior preparation</em>,
silently carried out till all is ready for a
decisive blow, whilst we are not ready
for equally efficient defence, and then a
declaration of war before we have time
to get properly ready, as the surprise in
this sense of France by Germany in
1870.</p>

<p>(A) Every successful example is always
copied, and usually on a larger scale.
We may be quite certain that our rivals
have taken to heart the lesson of Port
Arthur. It is possible that our next war
will open with a similar night attack on
our fleet, either just before, or simultaneously
with the declaration of war.
If it is successful, or even partially successful,
it may produce the most grave
results, as in the Russo-Japanese War.
It <em>may</em> render possible a naval action with
almost equal forces, in which our opponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
<em>might</em> be victorious. The invasion
of this country on a gigantic scale by
300,000 men or more would then follow
as a certainty. This is not a probability,
but a possibility which requires to be
kept in our view.</p>

<p>(B) <em>The surprise by superior preparation</em>,
as I term it, for want of a better
name, is a danger to which we are
peculiarly liable. As Lord Salisbury said,
"The British constitution is a bad fighting
machine," and it is made an infinitely
worse fighting machine by the lack of
interest which our politicians appear to
take in all that appertains to war. Hence
they are always liable to oppose, as
excessive, preparations which are in
reality the minimum consistent with
national safety. Consequently our preparations
for war, controlled as they are
by those who have no special knowledge
of war, are always apt to be insufficient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
as were those of France in 1870. In
former days this did not perhaps so very
much matter, although it resulted in the
unnecessary loss of hundreds of thousands
of British lives and hundreds of millions
of British treasure. But still we were
able, at this somewhat excessive price, to
"muddle through," owing to the heroic
efforts of our soldiers and sailors to make
bricks without straw and retrieve the
mistakes of our policy. For our opponents
then conducted war in such a
slow way as to give us time to repair
<em>after</em> the outbreak of war our lack of
preparation <em>before</em> it. But opposed to a
modern nation-in-arms, guided by statesmen
and led by generals brought up in
the school of Napoleon, Clausewitz, and
Moltke&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;all will be different. In such a
war the national forces brought into play
are so immense that it is only possible
to do so efficaciously if everything has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
been most carefully prepared and organized
beforehand. It is not <em>possible</em> to
improvise such organization of national
force <em>after</em> the war has begun, for there
cannot be sufficient time. If our rival
makes adequate preparation before the
war to bring to bear in that war the <em>whole</em>
of its national force, material, moral, and
physical, while we only prepare to bring
to bear a <em>small portion</em> thereof, then
there will be no time afterwards for us
to repair our negligence. The war will
be conducted with the utmost energy,
and the aim will be to utilize to the
utmost the superiority obtained by superior
preparation, so as to make the decision
as rapid as possible before we have time
to recover from the effects of our surprise.
That is the danger we have to fear, and
to keep ever in mind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">WAR AS POLICY</span></h2>

<p>"War," says Clausewitz, "is only a
continuation of State policy by other
means." The first question that at once
arises in the mind is what is meant by
Policy. We may safely lay down that
State policy is the defence and furtherance
of the interests of the nation as a whole
amidst the play of the conflicting tendencies
towards rest and towards acquisition,
and that its instruments are the
pen and the sword. There can, of course,
be any degree of consistency or fickleness,
of strength or weakness, of success or
failure, in the policy of a State.</p>

<p>Clausewitz expressly stated that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
hoped "to iron out many creases in the
heads of strategists and statesmen," such,
for instance, as the idea that it is possible
to consider either policy or war as
independent of the other.</p>

<p>It is only possible to obtain a proper
conception of policy if we regard it as
continuous both in peace and war, using
sometimes peace negotiations, sometimes
war negotiations, as circumstances require,
to attain the political object.</p>

<p>War is only a part of policy, a continuance
of the previous negotiations;
but the instrument is now the sword
and not the pen. As Clausewitz says,
"<em>In one word, the art of war, in its
highest point of view, is policy; but no
doubt a policy which fights battles instead
of writing notes.</em>" War is merely a
means whereby a nation attempts to
impose its will upon another nation in
order to attain a political object. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
object is settled by policy, which also
orders the war, determines what sort of
war it is to be, with what means and
resources and expenditure it is to be
waged, when its object has been attained,
and when it is to cease. In fact, policy
prepares, leads up to, orders, supports,
guides, and stops the war. As Clausewitz
said, "<em>All the leading outlines of a war
are always determined by the Cabinet&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
is, by a political, not a military
functionary.</em>"</p>

<p>Unity of thought is only to be obtained
by "the conception that war is only a
part of political intercourse, therefore by
no means an independent thing in itself."
"And how can we conceive it to be
otherwise? Does the cessation of diplomatic
notes stop the political relations
between different nations and governments?
Is not war merely another kind
of writing and language for political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
thoughts?" "Accordingly war can
never be separated from political intercourse;
and if, in the consideration
of the matter, this is done in any way,
all the threads of the different relations
are, to a certain extent, broken, and we
have before us a senseless thing without
an object."</p>

<p>"If war belongs to policy, it will
naturally take its character from policy.
If the policy is grand and powerful, so
will also be the war, and this may be
carried to the point at which war attains
to its absolute form." "Only through
this kind of view war recovers unity;
only by it can we see <em>all</em> wars of <em>one</em>
kind, and it is only through it that the
judgment can obtain the true and perfect
basis and point of view from which <em>great
plans</em> may be traced out and determined
upon."</p>

<p>"There is upon the whole nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
more important in life than to find out
the <em>right</em> point of view from which things
should be looked at and judged of, and
then to keep to that point; for we can
only apprehend the mass of events in
their unity from <em>one</em> standpoint; and
it is only the keeping to one point of
view that guards us from inconsistency."
"We can only look at policy here as the
representative of the interests generally
of the whole community," and "<em>wars
are in reality only the expressions or
manifestations of policy itself</em>."</p>

<p>To the student of history this unity of
conception is equally necessary, for it
supplies the key to many a military
puzzle. Without it we can never understand,
for instance, Napoleon's conduct
in 1812, 1813, 1814; nor without it can
we see the compelling reason of many
battles, apparently fought against military
judgment, such, for instance, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Borodino, Leipzig, Sedan, etc. We have
to remember that these and many other
battles, as, for instance, Ladysmith, were
fought from a political, not a military,
motive. It is a well-known fact that
the strategist frequently has to alter and
adapt his plans so as to suit overmastering
political necessity. Yet many people have
failed to draw therefrom the generalization
of Clausewitz that "war is only a
continuation of State policy by other
means." But having got it now, let us
hold fast to it, with all its consequences.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Knowledge of War necessary for
Statesmen</span></h3>

<p>"From this point of view there is no
longer in the nature of things a necessary
conflict between the political and military
interests, and where it appears it is therefore
to be regarded as <em>imperfect knowledge</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
only. That policy makes demands upon
the war which it cannot respond to,
would be contrary to the supposition that
<em>it knows the instrument it is going to use</em>,
therefore contrary to a natural and
<em>indispensable supposition</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>None of the principal plans which
are required for a war can be made without
an insight into the political relations</em>;
and in reality when people speak, as
they often do, of the prejudicial influence
of policy on the conduct of a war, they
say in reality something very different
to what they intend. It is not this
influence, but the policy itself which
should be found fault with. If policy is
right, if it succeeds in hitting the object,
then it can only act on the war also with
advantage; and if this influence of
policy causes a divergence from the
object, the cause is to be looked for in
a mistaken policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
"It is only when policy promises itself
a wrong effect from certain military
means and measures, an effect opposed
to their nature, that it can exercise a
prejudicial effect on war by the course
it prescribes. Just as a person in a
language with which he is not conversant
sometimes says what he does not intend,
<em>so policy, when intending right, may
often order things which do not tally with
its own views</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>This has happened times without
end, and it shows that a certain knowledge
of the nature of war is essential to the
management of political intercourse.</em>"</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The War Minister</span></h3>

<p>"Before going further we must guard
ourselves against a false interpretation
of which this is very susceptible. We do
not mean to say that this acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
with the nature of war is the <em>principal</em>
qualification for a war minister. Elevation,
superiority of mind, strength of
character, these are the principal qualifications
which he must possess; a knowledge
of war may be supplied in one way
or another."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Policy and the means to carry out that
Policy must Harmonize</span></h3>

<p>"<em>If war is to harmonize entirely with
the political views, and policy to accommodate
itself to the means available for
war</em>, there is only one alternative to be
recommended when the statesman and
soldier are not combined in one person
(note, as William of Orange, Frederick
the Great, or Napoleon), which is to
make the chief commander an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex-officio</i>
member of the Cabinet, that he may
take part in its councils and decisions on
important occasions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
"The influence of any military man
except the general-in-chief in the Cabinet
is extremely dangerous; it very seldom
leads to able, vigorous action."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>We shall conclude this chapter with a
few reflections on the preceding dicta
of Clausewitz, with which it is hoped
that the reader will agree.</p>

<p>Firstly, then, it is clearly apparent that
war is subordinate to policy, is an instrument
of policy, is a part of policy, just
as much as diplomatic negotiations are a
part of policy.</p>

<p>Secondly, a statesman, however good
at peaceful administration he may be,
who is ignorant of war is, therefore,
ignorant of one part of his profession;
that part which deals with the preparing,
ordering, guiding, and controlling of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
As Clausewitz says, "it is an <em>indispensable
supposition</em> that policy knows the instrument
it is going to use." It is a mistake
to suppose, when diplomatic relations
between two States cease, and war breaks
out, that therefore the political negotiations
cease, for they do not, but are
merely continued in another form&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in
the form of war. The statesman still
retains control, and uses the military
events as they occur to attain his object.
He is still responsible for the success
of the warlike, as well as of the peaceful,
policy of the nation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is a disputed point how
far the influence of policy is theoretically
allowable during the course of actual
operations, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> after the war has actually
begun. Moltke's opinion was that policy
should only act at the beginning and at
the end of a war, and should keep clear
during the actual operations. Clausewitz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
however, holds that the two are so
intimately related that the political influence
cannot be lost sight of even
during actual operations. Between two
such authorities we may well hesitate
to give a definite opinion, and must
seek for the middle way. Undoubtedly,
in history policy often has really affected
the actual operations, as in 1812, 1813,
1814, 1864, Macmahon's march to Sedan,
or Bismarck's interference to hurry on
the siege of Paris in 1870, or Ladysmith
in the Boer War, and in many other
cases. That, we must admit. We must
also admit that its interference frequently
produces a weakening effect on the
operations. Clausewitz says that that
only occurs when the policy itself is
wrong. Perhaps. But the safest middle
way rule appears to be this, that policy
should be dominant at the beginning
and end of a war, but during actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
operations the statesman should exercise
the greatest possible restraint, and
avoid all interference, except when
demanded by <em>overwhelming political
necessity</em>.</p>

<p>Fourthly, a politician is bound to study
war. He is bound to study war as well
as diplomacy, his two instruments. If
he only studies how to use one of his
two instruments, he will be a poor statesman
indeed. It is plain that he <span class="smcap smaller">MUST</span>
study war, so that he may not try to
use an instrument of which he knows
nothing. It is not meant, of course,
that a politician should study all the
details of naval and military matters,
but only that he should study the general
principles of war, and the means, resources,
and forces required to attain
the political object of war, through the
submission of the enemy.</p>

<p>Fifthly, in order that the object and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the means of policy may harmonize, it
is necessary that the one to whom the
national interests are entrusted should
study the principles of war, so that <em>he may
keep his policy proportionate to the means
of enforcing it</em>. That is to say, he must
not propose or commit the nation to a
policy which is likely to be strongly
opposed by another Power, unless he has
from careful study and enquiry made
certain that he has sufficient armed
force at his disposal, in case the opposing
nation suddenly challenges his policy
and declares war. He should not even
consider a policy without <em>at the same
time</em> considering with his military and
naval advisers the nation's means of
enforcing that policy if challenged to do
so. He must not think of embarking
upon a war, or of provoking another
nation to do so, till he has carefully provided
sufficient armed force to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
reasonable prospect, if not a certainty,
of success. Otherwise,</p>

<p>Sixthly, as our next contest will be
with a nation-in-arms, as the war will
be in its character absolute, as its object
will be the downfall of the foe, as not
until the foe (whether it be Great Britain
or not) lies powerless upon the ground
will it be supposed possible to stop, as
we shall have to contend against the
utmost means, the utmost energy, the
utmost efforts of a whole people-in-arms,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;these
points deserve the most serious
consideration of every politician who
aspires to guide the destinies of the
Anglo-Saxon Race.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<span class="subhead">STRATEGY</span></h2>

<p>Clausewitz defines strategy as "<em>the use
of the battle to gain the object of the war</em>."
War is "a chain of battles all strung
together, one of which always brings on
<span class="locked">another."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> The great thing in strategy
is to win these battles one after the
other till the enemy submits. "<em>The best
strategy is always to be very strong, first,
generally; secondly, at the decisive point.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>"In such an aspect we grant that the
superiority of numbers is the most important
factor in the result of a battle,
only it must be sufficiently great to be a
counterpoise to all the other co-operating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
circumstances. The direct result of all
this is that the <em>greatest possible number
of troops should be brought into action at
the decisive point</em>.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Whether the troops
thus brought up are sufficient or not,
we have then done in this respect all
that our means allowed. This is <em>the
first great principle of strategy</em>, as well
suited for Greeks or Persians, or for
Englishmen, or Mahrattas, as for French
or Germans."</p>

<p>It sounds so simple, and yet how many
times has it not been done. How many
generals have been ruined in consequence!</p>

<h3 class="vspace"><span class="smcap">Superiority in Numbers<br />
What is Required for Strategic Certainty</span></h3>

<p>Clausewitz says, "It is a fact that we
may search modern military history in
vain for a battle (except Leuthen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Rosbach) in which an army has beaten
another double its own strength, an
occurrence by no means uncommon in
former times. Bonaparte, the greatest
general of modern days, in all his great
victorious battles, with one exception,
that of Dresden 1813, had managed to
assemble an army superior in numbers,
or at least very little inferior, to that of
his opponent, and when it was impossible
for him to do so, as at Leipzig, Brienne,
Laon, Waterloo, he was <span class="locked">beaten."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> "From
this we may infer, in the present state of
Europe, that it is very difficult for the
most talented general to gain a victory
over an enemy double his strength.
Now, if we see that double numbers are
such a weight in the scale against even
the greatest generals, we may be sure
that in ordinary cases, in small as well
as in great combats, an important superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of numbers, but which need not
be over <em>two to one</em>, will be sufficient to
<em>ensure the victory</em>, however disadvantageous
other circumstances may <span class="locked">be."<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>The double superiority of numbers at
the decisive point is, therefore, the ideal
of strategy. "<em>The superiority of numbers
is, therefore, to be regarded as the
fundamental idea, always to be aimed at,
before all</em>, and as far as possible." If
strategy has done this, then it has done
its utmost duty. It is then for the
tactician to make the most of this
superiority thus provided by strategy,
and win the victory. Strategy then repeats
the operation with new combinations
suited to the altered circumstances
to win the next battle, and so on, till the
hostile armed force is destroyed.</p>

<p>This <em>superiority of numbers</em> in battle as
the <em>first principle of strategy</em> we require,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
on all occasions in season and out of
season, to repeat and repeat. At present
we have not the numbers we shall want.
We must get them. Otherwise we are
bound to be inferior in numbers, and
"the best strategy" will be possible for
our enemies and impossible for us. This
rests with our statesmen.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Decisive Point</span></h3>

<p>If the double superiority, or as near
the double as possible, at the decisive
point is the ideal of strategy ... what
is the decisive point?</p>

<p>Here we owe another debt to Clausewitz.
Jomini, even after Napoleon, confuses
us with three different sorts of
decisive points in a theatre of war, but
Clausewitz clears the air by asserting
only <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>"But whatever may be the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
point of the enemy's power against
which we are to direct our ultimate
operations, <em>still the conquest and destruction
of his army is the surest commencement</em>
and, <em>in all cases, the most essential</em>."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Here we have it in a nutshell; wherever
the enemy's main force is <span class="smcap smaller">THERE</span> is the
decisive point, against which we must
concentrate <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> our forces.</p>

<p>"There are," said Napoleon, "many
good generals in Europe, but they see
too many things at one time. <em>As for
me, I see only one thing, the enemy's
chief army, and I concentrate all my
efforts to destroy it.</em>"</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Simultaneous Use of all the Forces</span></h3>

<p>"The rule," says Clausewitz, "which
we have been endeavouring to set forth
is, therefore, that all the forces which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
are available and destined for a strategic
object should be <em>simultaneously</em> applied
to it. And this application will be all
the more complete the more everything
is compressed into one act and one
<span class="locked">moment."<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> This he calls "<em>the law of
the simultaneous employment of the forces
in strategy</em>."<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> "In strategy we can
never employ too many <span class="locked">forces."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> "What
can be looked upon in tactics as an
excess of force must be regarded in
strategy as a means of giving expansion
to success." "<em>No troops should be kept
back as a strategic reserve</em>," but every
available man hurried up to the first
battlefield, fresh levies being meanwhile
formed in rear. As an instance of what
not to do, Prussia, in 1806, kept back
45,000 men in Brandenburg and East
Prussia; they might, if present at Jena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
have turned defeat into victory, but they
were useless <span class="locked">afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> A fault so
often made may be made again.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Concentration</span></h3>

<p>"It is impossible to be too strong at
the decisive point," said Napoleon. To
concentrate every available man and
gun at the decisive point so as to attain
superiority there, is not an easy thing,
for the enemy will be making a similar
attempt. "The calculation of time and
space appears the most essential thing
to this end. But the calculation of time
and space, though it lies universally at
the foundation of strategy, and is to a
certain extent its daily bread, is still
neither the most difficult nor the most
decisive one." "Much more frequently
the relative superiority, that is the skilful
assemblage of superior forces at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
decisive point, has its foundation in the
right appreciation of those points, in
the judicious distribution which by that
means has been given to the forces from
the very first, and in <em>the resolution to
sacrifice the unimportant to the advantage
of the important</em>. In this respect Frederick
the Great and Bonaparte are especially
<span class="locked">characteristic."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no simpler and more imperative
rule for strategy than <em>to keep all the
forces concentrated</em>. <em>No portion to be
separated from the main body unless
called away by some urgent necessity.</em> On
this maxim we stand firm, and look
upon it as a fact to be depended
<span class="locked">upon."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>The concentration of the whole force</em>
(<abbr>i.e.</abbr> within supporting distance) <em>should
be the rule</em>, and <em>every separation or
division is an exception which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
justified</em>."<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Of course, this does not
mean that all the troops are to be kept
concentrated in one mass upon one
road, but within supporting distance, for
he expressly states, "<em>It is sufficient
now if the concentration takes place during
the course of the action.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This doctrine,
qualified by the last sentence, makes
Clausewitz the germ of modern military
thought, for the last sentence leaves
room for all the modern developments of
new roads, railways, telegraphs, wire
and wireless, and so forth.</p>

<p>Therefore in war, according to Clausewitz,
concentration, concentration, concentration,
and <em>every division or detachment
is an evil which can only be justified
by urgent necessity</em>. Here again we find
a simple truth, which, however, the
history of all wars shows us to be very
difficult to carry out. Hence the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of keeping such an imperative maxim
always in our minds.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Pitched Battle</span></h3>

<p>"The more a general takes the field
in the true spirit of war, as well as of
every other contest, that he must and
<em>will</em> conquer, the more will he strive to
throw every weight into the scale in the
first battle, and hope and strive to win
everything by it. Napoleon hardly ever
entered upon a war without thinking of
conquering his enemy at once in the
first <span class="locked">battle."<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>At the very outset of war we must
direct all our efforts to gain the first battle</em>,
because an unfavourable issue is always
a disadvantage to which no one would
willingly expose himself, and also because
the first decision, though not the only
one, still will have the more influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
on subsequent events the greater it is
in <span class="locked">itself."<a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<p>"The law of the simultaneous use of
the forces in strategy lets the principal
result (which need not be the final one)
take place almost always at the commencement
of the great <span class="locked">act."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> A great
victory thus won at the outset will upset
all the enemy's plan of campaign and
allow us to carry out our own. The first
pitched battle is, therefore, the crisis of
the rival strategies, and towards its
favourable decision all our preparations,
all our forces, and all our energies should
be directed. This is a point that civilians
seem to find hard to grasp. Witness all
our history, with inadequate forces at
the beginning of every war, as even in
the latest of our wars&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that in South
Africa. It is a point which our statesmen
should very seriously consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
The difficulty of concentrating superior
numbers for the first battle is that the
enemy will be, or should be, of the same
opinion, and will be making equal efforts
to win the first battle. So, then, the
crisis will be all the more acute, the
battle greater, and the result greater.</p>

<p>"<em>We would not avoid showing at once
that the bloody solution of the crisis, the
effort for the destruction of the enemy's
main force, is the first-born son of war.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>Till this is done, the first great victory
gained, strategy should think of nothing
else.</p>

<p>Then, and only then, a further combination
in accordance with the altered
circumstances to win the next.</p>

<p>"For we maintain that, with few
exceptions, <em>the victory at the decisive
point will carry with it the decision on
all minor points</em>"<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> over the whole theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of war. Therefore nothing else matters
for long, and to victory in the first great
battle "everything else must be sacrificed."
For concentration can only be
obtained by sacrifice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pursuit</span></h3>

<p>"Once the great victory is gained, the
next question is not about rest, not about
taking breath, not about re-organizing,
etc., but only of pursuit, of fresh blows
wherever necessary, of the capture of
the enemy's capital, of the attack of the
armies of his allies, or whatever else
appears as a rallying point for the
<span class="locked">enemy."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span></p>

<p>Clausewitz points out that this is very
difficult, and that to compel his exhausted
troops vigorously to pursue till nightfall
requires <span class="smcap smaller">GREAT</span> force of <span class="smcap smaller">WILL</span> on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
part of the equally exhausted commander.
We need only remember that
Napoleon himself at the supreme crisis
of his fate, being physically tired, failed
to pursue the allies after his victory at
Dresden, 1813, whereby he lost all the
fruits of his victory, and indeed his last
chance of ultimate success.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Summary of Strategic Principles</span></h3>

<p>Leaving out, for the sake of shortness,
the rest of his strategical thoughts, I hasten
to conclude this sketch with a glance at
Clausewitz's admirable <span class="locked">summary<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> of strategic
<span class="locked">principles:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>"<em>The first and most important maxim
which we can set before ourselves is to
employ</em> <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> <em>the forces which we can make
available with the</em> <span class="smcap smaller">UTMOST ENERGY</span>. Even
if the result is tolerably certain in itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
it is extremely unwise not to make it
<em>perfectly certain</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>The second principle is to concentrate
our forces as much as possible at the point
where the</em> <span class="smcap smaller">DECISIVE</span> <em>blow is to be struck.
The success at that point will compensate
for all defeats at secondary points.</em></p>

<p>"<em>The third principle is not to lose
time. Rapidity and surprise are the most
powerful elements of victory.</em></p>

<p>"<em>Lastly, the fourth principle is to</em>
<span class="smcap smaller">FOLLOW UP THE SUCCESS</span> <em>we gain with
the</em> <span class="smcap smaller">UTMOST ENERGY</span>. <em>The pursuit of
the enemy when defeated is the only means
of gathering up the fruits of victory.</em></p>

<p>"The first of these principles is the
foundation of all the others. <em>If we have
followed the first principle, we can venture
any length with regard to the three others
without risking our all.</em> It gives the
means of <em>continually creating new forces
behind us</em>, and with new forces every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
disaster may be repaired. <em>In this, and
not in going forward with timid steps,
lies that prudence which may be called
wise.</em>"</p>

<p>These great principles are everything
in war, and "due regard being paid to
these principles, the form (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> the geometrical
element) in which the operations
are carried on is in the end of little consequence."</p>

<p>"Therefore I am perfectly convinced
that whoever calls forth all his powers
to appear <em>incessantly with new masses</em>,
whoever adopts <em>every imaginable means of
preparation</em>, whoever <em>concentrates his force
at the decisive point, whoever thus armed
pursues a great object with resolution and
energy</em>, has done all that can be done
in a general way for the strategical conduct
of the war, and that, unless he is
altogether unfortunate in battle, will
undoubtedly be victorious in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
measure that his adversary has fallen
short of this exertion and energy."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>When we have got these great simple
leading principles of strategy firmly into
our heads, the next question is how to
make use of our knowledge. For principles
are no use unless we apply them.
On consideration it appears that there
are three ways in which we can all apply
these principles with advantage.</p>

<p>I. It will prove a very interesting and
strengthening mental exercise to apply
these few leading principles to every
campaign we read about, to search for
indications of their application in the
strategy of each belligerent, how far each
commander succeeded, and how far failed
to carry them out in their entirety, and
where, when, and why he succeeded or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
failed, and the results of doing or not
doing so. Also to search for the interaction
of the political motive of the war
on the military operations, and to see
how far the belligerent statesmen gained
or failed to gain their political object,
according to the comparative degree of
preparation they had made for it, and the
magnitude of effort which they made
or did not make to support it with the
whole means of the nation, material,
moral and physical. Also to see how far
the national spirit was aroused or not,
and the causes thereof, and to note the
greater or less energy, resolution and
boldness which was consequently infused
into the war. Also to note how the
thorough application of these great simple
principles of strategy shortens the war
and thereby reduces its cost (1866 to
1870), and how the neglect of them by
statesmen, despite their fortitude afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
lengthens a war and adds to its
cost enormously (South Africa, etc.).
Used thus, these principles give us a
theoretically correct ground for criticism.</p>

<p>II. These principles also give us a
theoretically correct ground for anticipating
what the action of our opponents in
any future war will be, the measure of
the forces they will bring to bear, how
they will direct those forces, and the
amount of energy, resolution, and boldness
with which they will use them against
us. It is an axiom always to assume that
the enemy will do the best and wisest
thing, and to prepare accordingly.</p>

<p>III. These principles also give us a
theoretically correct ground for our own
counter-preparations. We require to take
the most dangerous war which is probable
or possible, and make every imaginable
preparation to carry out these principles
therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
In such a case how are we going to
render it possible for our generals to win,
and thus save the nation from the irreparable
consequences and the huge war
indemnity of £800,000,000 or so, which
would follow defeat? How are we going
to do it? How are we going to render
it possible for our generals to employ
the best strategy? The ideal of strategy,
always to be aimed at, is the double
superiority of numbers. How are we
going to give our generals that? If we
cannot do that, how are we going to give
them even any superiority <em>at all</em>, so that
they may be able to carry out the first
principle of strategy? How? Or are
we going to make <span class="smcap smaller">NO</span> <em>adequate preparations</em>
for these three eventualities, and
when one of them suddenly comes ask
our generals to save us from the fate we
have brought upon ourselves, by performing
the impossible? It is in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
that a statesman should use these few
great simple principles of strategy in
order to attain his political object and
safeguard the interests of the nation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE EXECUTION OF STRATEGY</span></h2>

<p>Now, as Clausewitz teaches it, the theory
of war is easy enough to understand.
There is no reason&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one might almost
say no excuse&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;why every one, soldier
or statesman, should not know it fairly
well. The great leading principles of
strategy are few and simple. There is
no reason why every one, soldier and
statesman, should not understand and
know these few simple principles thoroughly,
and have them at his finger ends
ready to apply them to the consideration
of any military question, past, present,
or future. So far all is easy. But when
it is a question of carrying out in actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
war this easy theory, these simple strategical
principles, then it is <span class="smcap smaller">QUITE</span> a different
matter, then it is a matter of the very
greatest difficulty. This is a difference
which the mind always finds very hard
to grasp, as witness the denunciations
with which any failure in execution by
a general, no matter how great the real
difficulties with which he had to contend,
is nearly always greeted. Observers rarely
make allowances for these difficulties,
very largely probably because they do
not understand them. The present chapter
is devoted to these difficulties of
execution in war.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Genius for War</span></h3>

<p>In Clausewitz's great chapter on "the
genius for <span class="locked">war"<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> he sets forth the
difficulties which confront a general, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
character and genius, the driving and
animating force, required to overcome
the friction of war. It is impossible to
abstract it adequately; I can only advise
all to read it for themselves. But I will
endeavour to give an idea of it.</p>

<p>After discussing the various sorts of
courage required by a general, physical
before danger and moral before responsibility,
the strength of body and mind,
the personal pride, the patriotism, the
enthusiasm, etc., he comes to the unexpected.</p>

<p>"<em>War</em>," he says, "<em>is the province of
uncertainty. Three-fourths of those things
upon which action in war must be calculated
are hidden more or less in the
clouds of great uncertainty.</em> Here, then,
above all other, a fine and penetrating
mind is called for, to grope out the
truth by the tact of its judgment."
Mark this point, that three-fourths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the things that we as critics <span class="smcap smaller">AFTER</span> the
event know, when all information of the
situation has been collected and published,
were unknown to the general
who had to decide, or only dimly guessed
at from a number of contradictory reports.</p>

<p>"From this uncertainty of all intelligence
and suppositions, <em>this continual
interposition of chance</em>." "Now, if he
is to get safely through <em>this perpetual
conflict with the unexpected</em>, two qualities
are indispensable; in the first place <em>an
understanding which, even in the midst
of this intense obscurity, is not without
some traces of inner light</em>, which <em>lead to
the truth</em>, and then <em>the courage to follow
this faint light</em>. The first is expressed by
the French phrase <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i>; the second
is resolution."</p>

<p>"Resolution is an <em>act of courage in
face of responsibility</em>." "The forerunner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of resolution is an act of the mind making
plain the necessity of venturing and thus
influencing the will. This quite peculiar
direction of the mind, which conquers
every other fear in man by the fear of
wavering or doubting, is what makes up
resolution in strong minds."</p>

<p>The vital importance of firmness and
resolution, so strongly urged by Clausewitz,
will be apparent to all if we reflect
how even the strongest characters have
been ruined by a temporary fit of vacillation
in war. Compare, for instance,
York <abbr>v.</abbr> Wartenburg's masterly exposition
of Napoleon's ruinous, suicidal vacillation
in 1813 at Dresden.</p>

<p>Also there is required "<em>the power of
listening to reason in the midst of the
most intense excitement</em>, in the storm of
the most violent passions."</p>

<p>"But to keep to the result of by-gone
reflections in opposition to the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
of opinions and phenomena which the
present brings with it, is just <span class="smcap smaller">THE</span> difficulty."
"Here nothing else can help
us but an imperative maxim which,
independent of reflection, at once controls
it: that maxim is, <em>in all doubtful cases
to adhere to the first opinion and not to
give it up till a clear conviction forces us
to do so</em>."</p>

<p>"But as soon as difficulties arise, and
that must always happen when great
results are at stake, then the machine,
the army itself, begins to offer a sort
of passive resistance, and to overcome
this the commander must have great
force of will." Driving power, such as
Napoleon's. And also "the heart-rending
sight of the bloody sacrifice, which the
commander has to contend with in himself."</p>

<p>"These are the weights which the
courage and intelligent faculties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
commander have to contend with and
<span class="smcap smaller">OVERCOME</span>, if he is to make his name
illustrious." If he is to prevent the
downfall of his country.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections</span></h3>

<p>(1) In connection with these difficulties
I would like to put forward a suggestion
as to criticism of a general's action in
war, which though not exactly Clausewitz's,
is a corollary from Clausewitz.
It is this. In reading a war with the
clearness and after-knowledge of history
nearly all defeats are easily seen to be
due to the non-observance of one or
other of the few leading principles of
strategy referred to in the previous
chapter. But we must assume that the
defeated general was <em>familiar</em> with that
principle, and that his <em>will</em> was to carry
it out. What, then, were the difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the friction, which, on any particular
day or days, overcame his will and
made him sacrifice the principle? This
is where most critics fail us. Here seems
the matter to search for. And could a
stronger resolution have enabled him to
overcome those difficulties, that friction?
And if so, how and by what means?
But we must first discover the difficulties
and uncertainties of the particular day
when his will gave way. Take the
Manchurian campaign as an instance.
If we could only have a military history
of the campaign of 1870 or that of
Manchuria, written in the form of a
series of "appreciations of the situation,"
so that we know nothing but what the
general knew at the time as we read, and
if the true state of affairs could be withheld
from us till the end, this, I think,
would be very instructive and helpful.
It would be a more difficult way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
writing a military history, but I think
that the extra trouble would be repaid
by the extra value. So at least it appears.</p>

<p>(2) If we reflect upon the enormous
difficulties, so strikingly brought out by
Clausewitz, which <em>our</em> generals have to
contend with and <em>overcome</em> in actual war,
it should surely teach us to curb our
criticism. It should surely also make us
resolve in future to try to aid them as
far as is in our power at home, and not
thoughtlessly to increase their already
stupendous burdens. In the past we at
home have much to accuse ourselves of,
much to regret. In the past often
have we added to the difficulties of our
generals, often have we greatly weakened
their chances, and increased those of their
opponents, often have we, unintentionally,
through ignorance cast a weight
into the scale against our country.</p>

<p>(3) The ignorance of the public regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the conduct of war constitutes
for us a very serious national danger.
If this ignorance were less pronounced,
if our statesmen understood the vast
importance of information to the enemy,
and the equal importance to our generals
that this information the enemy should
<span class="smcap smaller">NOT</span> obtain, then the public craving for
information regarding every detail of
what occurs in the field, and the demand
for the wide publication thereof, would
certainly be repressed. Nothing occurs
in any of our campaigns which is not
immediately made known; reports of
actions with the fullest details as to the
troops engaged, and the casualties that
have befallen them, appear in the columns
of the Press within a few hours of their
occurrence. <em>Any efforts, therefore, of our
generals</em> in the field to maintain <em>secrecy
as to strength, intentions, and movements
are deliberately</em>, though probably unintentionally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
<em>counteracted by their own
countrymen</em>. This is due to pure ignorance
of war, no doubt, but the effect
of this ignorance is as bad as if it were
due to evil intention. In fairness, however,
we must admit that, in the past,
the immense value of reticence has not
been fully appreciated by some of our
soldiers themselves, and it were well if,
in the future, more attention were directed
to the importance of secrecy.</p>

<p>The results of such almost criminal
stupidity may not be apparent when we
are fighting with a savage foe, but if
we ever have, as we undoubtedly some
day shall have, the misfortune to find
ourselves engaged with a civilized Power,
we may be certain that not only will the
operations be indefinitely prolonged, <em>and
their cost enormously increased</em>, but their
successful issue will be for us highly
problematical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
In this connection it must be remembered
that every Great Power has secret
agents in every country, including Great
Britain, and that it will be easy for such a
secret agent to telegraph in cypher or
in some agreed code to an agent in a
neutral State all war information published
here, who will telegraph it on at
once to the hostile general, who will
thus get, within a very short time of its
publication in London, perhaps just exactly
the information he requires to clear up
the strategical or tactical situation for
him, and enable him to defeat the combinations
of our generals. As a case in
point, take Macmahon's march on Sedan
to relieve Metz in 1870, where secrecy
was absolutely necessary for success, but
which became known to the Germans
by the English newspapers.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Result,
Sedan.</p>

<p>That this cannot be allowed is plain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
It is believed that the patriotism of our
Press will welcome any necessary measure
to this end if it is made compulsory upon
<span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span>.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">TACTICS</span></h2>

<p>Some will probably feel inclined to ask
what Clausewitz, who wrote more than
eighty years ago, can possibly have to
say about tactics which can be valuable
in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>It was said by Napoleon that tactics
change every ten years, according, of
course, to the progress of technicalities,
etc. Weapons indeed change, but there
is one thing that never changes, and
that is human nature. The most important
thing in tactics, the man behind
the gun, never alters; in his heart and
feelings, his strength and weakness, he is
always much the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Therefore, Clausewitz's tactical deductions,
founded on the immense and varied
data supplied by the desperate and long-continued
fighting of the Revolutionary
and Napoleonic wars, permeated as they
are by his all-pervading psychological or
moral view, can never lose their value
to us.</p>

<p>It is true, no doubt, that our rifles of
to-day can be used with effect at a
distance ten times as great as the old
smooth bores of Clausewitz's day, our
shrapnel five times as far as his cannon,
and that cover and ground play a far
more important part now than then, and
so on. All these things, of course, considerably
modify the tactics of Clausewitz.
Not so much, however, as some text-books
would lead us to suppose, which always
seem to assume clear ground and clear
weather. For, after all, how many combats
are fought on ground where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
is a very restricted field of fire (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i>
Herbert's "Defence of Plevna," etc.), or
at night? How many battles are fought
during rain, or snow, or mist, or fog,
which destroys all long range? Compare
the tremendous fighting with "bullets,
bayonets, swords, hand-grenades, and
even fists," of Nogi's attempt to cut the
Russian line of retreat at Mukden, with
the hand-to-hand fighting of Eylau, Friedland,
Borodino, or with the desperate
efforts of the French in 1812 to open their
line of retreat through Maro-Jaroslawitz,
where all day the masses of troops fought
hand-to-hand in the streets, "the town
was taken and retaken seven times, and
the rival nations fought with the bayonet
in the midst of the burning houses"
(Alison).</p>

<p>When it comes to push of pike, as in
all great decisions between equally resolute
adversaries it is bound to do, the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
between the fighting of Clausewitz's
day and ours is but small. The most
recent instances of all, the hand-to-hand
fighting in Manchuria, take us back to
the Napoleonic struggles.</p>

<p>Therefore, despite the eighty years
that have intervened, the writings of
Clausewitz are still valuable from a
tactical point of view, always considering
of course the difference in weapons,
because of the human heart in battle.</p>

<p>His ideas on tactics have largely filtered
through his German pupils into our textbooks,
minus the psychological or moral
note, so that it is not necessary to go at
length into the subject, or give a number
of extracts. It would be wearisome. I
will, however, give a few passages at haphazard
as illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Flank Attacks</span></h3>

<p>The endeavour to gain the enemy's line
of retreat, and protect our own, on
which so much learned erudition has
been spent by various writers, he regards
as a <span class="smcap smaller">NATURAL</span> instinct, which will <span class="smcap smaller">ALWAYS</span>
produce itself both in generals and subalterns.</p>

<p>"From this arises, in the whole conduct
of war, and especially in great and small
combats, a <span class="smcap smaller">PERFECT INSTINCT</span>, which is
the security of our own line of retreat
and the seizure of the enemy's; this
follows from the conception of victory,
which, as we have seen, is something
beyond mere slaughter. In this effort
we see, therefore, the <span class="smcap smaller">FIRST</span> immediate
purpose in the combat, and one which
is quite universal. No combat is <em>imaginable</em>
in which this effort, either in its
double or single form, is not to go hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
in hand with the plain and simple stroke
of force. Even the smallest troop will
not throw itself upon the enemy without
thinking of its line of retreat, and in
most cases it will have an eye upon that
of the <span class="locked">enemy."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> "This is a great
<em>natural law</em> of the combat," "and so
becomes the pivot upon which <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> strategical
and tactical man&oelig;uvres turn."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reserves&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Destructive and Decisive Act</span></h3>

<p>The combat he regards as settled by
whoever has the preponderance of moral
force at the end; that is, in fresh or only
partly used up troops.</p>

<p>The combat itself he divides into a
destructive and a decisive act. During
the long destructive act, or period of fire
preparation, the troops engaged gradually
wear each other out, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
almost cease to count as factors in the
decision. "After a fire combat of some
hours' duration, in which a body of
troops has suffered severe losses&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for
instance, a quarter or one-third of its
numbers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> may for the time
be looked upon as a heap of cinders.
For the men are physically exhausted;
they have spent their ammunition; many
have left the field with the wounded,
though not themselves wounded (compare,
for instance, Eylau and the 1870 battles);
the rest think they have done their part
for the day, and if they get beyond the
sphere of danger, do not willingly return
to it. The feeling of courage with which
they originally started has had the edge
taken off, the longing for the fight is
satisfied, the original organization is partly
destroyed, and the formations broken up."</p>

<p>"So that the amount of moral force
lost may be estimated by the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the Reserves used up, almost as with a
foot <span class="locked">rule."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span></p>

<p>This goes on till, "In all probability,
only the untouched reserve and some
troops which, though they have been in
action, have suffered very little, are in
reality to be regarded as serviceable, and
the remainder (perhaps four-sixths) may
be looked upon for the present as a
"caput mortuum."</p>

<p>Therefore the art of the commander
he regards as "economy of force" during
the destructive period; that is, to employ
as few troops as possible, by taking
advantage of ground, cover, etc., "to
use a smaller number of men in the
combat with firearms than the enemy
employs," so that a smaller proportionate
number of his own are reduced to a
"heap of cinders" and more are left,
more moral force, for the decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
"Hundreds of times," he says, "a line
of fire has maintained its own against
one twice its strength" (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> the Boers).</p>

<p>To do this and yet obtain a good fire-effect
demands very skilful handling of
the troops, both on the part of the chief
and subordinate leaders.</p>

<p>With the preponderance thus obtained
the commander at last starts the decision.
"Towards the close of a battle the line
of retreat is always regarded with increased
jealousy, therefore a threat against that
line is always a potent means of bringing
on the decision (Liao-yang, Mukden).
On that account, when circumstances
permit, the plan of battle will be aimed
at that point from the very first." Or,
"If this wear and tear and exhaustion
of the forces has reached a certain pitch,
then a rapid advance in concentrated
masses on one side against the line of
battle of the other" (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> the Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
breaking the centre, of recent years
thought almost hopeless, but revived in
Manchuria with success, in the case of
Nodzu breaking the centre at Mukden).</p>

<p>From what precedes it is evident that,
as in the preparatory acts, the utmost
economy of forces must prevail, so in
the decisive act to win the mastery
through <em>numbers</em> must be the ruling idea.</p>

<p>Just as in the preparatory acts endurance,
firmness and coolness are the first
qualities, so in the decisive act boldness
and fiery spirit must predominate.</p>

<p>"The difference between these two
acts will never be completely lost as
respects the whole."</p>

<p>"This is the way in which our view
is to be understood; then, on the one
hand, it will not come short of the
reality, and on the other it will direct
the attention of the leader of a combat
(be it great or small, partial or general)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to giving each of the two acts of activity
its due share, so that there may be
neither precipitation nor negligence.</p>

<p>"<em>Precipitation</em> there will be if space
and time are not allowed for the destructive
act. <em>Negligence</em> in general there will
be if a complete decision does not take
place, either from want of moral courage
or from a wrong view of the <span class="locked">situation."<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Duration of the Combat</span></h3>

<p>"Even the resistance of an ordinary
division of 8,000 or 10,000 men of all
arms, even if opposed to an enemy considerably
superior in numbers, will last
several hours, if the advantages of country
are not too preponderating. And if the
enemy is only a little or not at all superior
in numbers, the combat will last half a
day. A corps of three or four divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
will prolong it to double that time; an
army of 80,000 or 100,000 men to three
or four times." "These calculations are
the result of <span class="locked">experience."<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span></p>

<p>As General von Caemmerer points out,
if these calculations were adhered to in
present-day German man&oelig;uvres, as they
are now in all war games, tactical exercises,
and staff rides, the dangerous
dualism of their training, the difference
between theory and man&oelig;uvre practice,
would cease.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Attack and Defence</span></h3>

<p>I have left to the last the consideration
of three or four disputed points in Clausewitz.
In considering these I shall quote
a good deal from General von Caemmerer's
"Development of Strategical
Science," as in such matters it is best to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
quote the most recent authors of established
reputation.</p>

<p>The most important of these, and the
most disputed, is Clausewitz's famous
dictum that "the defensive is the stronger
form of making war." "The defence is
the stronger form of war with a negative
object; the attack is the weaker form
with a positive <span class="locked">object."<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span></p>

<p>General von Caemmerer says, "It is
strange, we Germans look upon Clausewitz
as indisputably the deepest and
acutest thinker upon the subject of war;
the beneficial effect of his intellectual
labours is universally recognized and
highly appreciated; but the more or
less keen opposition against this sentence
never ceases. And yet that sentence
can as little be cut out of his work 'On
War' as the heart out of a man. Our
most distinguished and prominent military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
writers are here at variance with
Clausewitz.</p>

<p>"Now, of course, I do not here propose
to go into such a controversy. I only
wish to point out that Clausewitz, in
saying this, only meant the defensive-offensive,
the form in which he always
regards it, both strategically and technically,
in oft-repeated explanations all
through his works. For <span class="locked">instance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>"It is a <span class="smcap smaller">FIRST</span> maxim <span class="smcap smaller">NEVER</span> to remain
perfectly passive, but to fall upon the
enemy in front and flank, even when he
is in the act of making an attack upon <span class="locked">us."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p>And <span class="locked">again&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>"<em>A swift and vigorous assumption of
the offensive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the flashing sword of vengeance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is
the most brilliant point in the
defensive.</em> He who does not at once
think of it at the right moment, or rather
he who does not from the first include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
this transition in his idea of the defensive,
will never understand its superiority as a
form of <span class="locked">war."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> Von Caemmerer comments
thus: "And this conception of
the defence by Clausewitz has become
part and parcel of our army&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;everywhere,
strategically and tactically, he who has
been forced into a defensive attitude at
once thinks how he can arrange a counter-attack.
I am thus unable to see how
the way in which Clausewitz has contrasted
Attack and Defence could in any
way paralyse the spirit of enterprise."
Von Caemmerer also justly remarks that,
as Clausewitz always insisted both in
strategy and tactics, neither Attack nor
Defence is pure, but oscillates between
the two forms; and as the Attack is
frequently temporarily reduced to defend
itself, and also as no nation can be sure
of never being invaded by a superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
coalition, it is most desirable to encourage
a belief in the strength of the Defence,
if properly used. In this I think that
Wellington would probably have agreed.
Certainly Austerlitz and Waterloo were
examples of battles such as Clausewitz
preferred.</p>

<p>Still, one must admit that Clausewitz's
chapter on "The Relations of the Offensive
and Defensive to each other in
Tactics," Book VII. Chapter 2, is the
least convincing chapter of his work.</p>

<p>Strategically, the argument is stronger.
It always seems to me that we must
remember that Clausewitz had taken
part in the defensive-offensive in its
strongest, most absolute and unlimited
form, on the greatest possible scale&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
Moscow campaign and the ruin (consummated
before a single flake of snow fell)
of the Grand Army. If he had lived to
complete the revision of his works, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
always seems to me that he would have
made his theory undeniable by stating
that the defensive is the strongest form
of war, <em>if unlimited by space</em>. What, for
instance, would have happened if the
Japanese had tried to march through
Siberia on to St. Petersburg?</p>

<p>But, after all, which of the two is
absolutely the stronger form of war,
attack or defence, is merely a theoretical
abstraction, for, practically, the choice
is always settled for us by the pressing
necessity of circumstances. And, in this
connection, let us always bear in mind
Clausewitz's dictum: "A swift and
vigorous assumption of the offensive&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
flashing sword of vengeance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is the
most brilliant point in the defensive."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Inner Line</span></h3>

<p>A second disputed point is Clausewitz's
alleged preference, as a rule, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Inner Line in strategy. But it is necessary
to remember that that was only
due to the conditions of his time, before
railways and telegraphs, when it was
difficult to communicate between columns
acting on concentric lines. And he is
not in any way wedded to the Inner
Line, like Jomini, but <em>only</em> when circumstances
are favourable. He has many
sentences from which we may infer that,
had he lived in railway and telegraph
days, his strategy, like Moltke's, his most
distinguished pupil, would have aimed
at envelopment as a rule. For to bring
up troops rapidly by several railways
necessitates a broad strategic front, and
Clausewitz especially lays down rapidity
as his second great principle, and <span class="locked">says&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<p>"If the concentration of the forces
would occasion detours and loss of time,
and the danger of advancing by separate
lines is not too great, then the same may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
be justifiable on these grounds; for <em>to
effect an unnecessary concentration of the
forces</em> would be contrary to the second
principle we have laid down (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> 'to act
as swiftly as possible')."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Also: "Such
separation into several columns as is
absolutely necessary must be made use
of for the disposition of the tactical attack
in the enveloping form, <em>for that form is
natural to the attack, and must not be
disregarded without good reason</em>."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Also:
"<em>It is sufficient now if the concentration
takes place during the action.</em>" So that
while the conditions of his time led
Clausewitz to prefer close concentration
and the Inner Line, like Napoleon, yet his
reflections led him to propound the
germ of the strategy of Moltke. Substitute
for Clausewitz's close concentration
this: "As close concentration, the combined
movements regulated by telegraph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
as is compatible with the utmost use of
the railways and the greatest rapidity"
(as he would certainly have said), and
we arrive at Moltke's strategy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Frontal Attacks</span></h3>

<p>A third disputed point is his belief in
the superior tactical efficiency, under
favourable circumstances, of the Napoleonic
method of breaking the enemy's
line in the centre. Breaking the line by
a frontal attack was, of course, much
easier in Clausewitz's Napoleonic day
than it is with the long-ranging arms of
our day, and it is only natural that
Clausewitz in his writings should give it
the full tactical importance which it then
deserved. His book would not be true
to the tactical conditions of his day had
he not done so, with Rivoli, Austerlitz,
Salamanca, Eckmuhl, etc., before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
mind. But it seems hardly correct to
accuse him of over-partiality to frontal
attacks, for he has examined both frontal
and enveloping attacks most fairly, giving
to each their relative advantages and
disadvantages, and concluding: "The
envelopment may lead directly to the
<em>destruction</em> of the enemy's army, if it is
made with very superior numbers and
succeeds. If it leads to victory the early
results are <em>in every case</em> greater than by
breaking the enemy's line. Breaking the
enemy's line can only lead indirectly to
the destruction of the enemy's army, and
its effects are hardly shown so much on
the first day, but rather strategically
<span class="locked">afterwards,"<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> by forcing apart on different
lines of retreat the separated fragments
of the beaten army.</p>

<p>"The breaking through the hostile
army by massing our principal force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
against one point, <em>supposes an excessive
length of front on the part of the enemy</em>;
for in this form of attack the difficulty
of occupying the remainder of the enemy's
force with few troops is greater, because
the enemy's forces nearer to the principal
point of attack can easily join in opposing
it. Now in an attack upon the centre
there are such forces on both sides of
the attack; in an attack upon a flank,
only on one side. The consequence of
this is that such a central attack may
easily end in a very disadvantageous form
of combat, <em>through a convergent counter-attack</em>."
Which is exactly our modern
difficulty. "The choice between these two
forms of attack must therefore be made
according to the existing conditions of
the moment. Length of front, the nature
and direction of the line of retreat, the
military qualities of the enemy's troops,
and the characteristics of their general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
lastly the ground must determine the
choice."</p>

<p>Speaking generally he regards the <em>concentric</em>
enveloping form of tactical attack
aiming at the enemy's line of retreat as
the most efficacious and natural. "On
the field of battle itself ... the enveloping
form must always be considered the
most <span class="locked">effectual."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> And the <em>eccentric</em> or
frontal counter-attack at the extended
enveloping attack as the most efficacious
and natural form of the defence, such as
Napoleon's counter-attacks at Austerlitz
or Dresden, or Wellington's at Salamanca.
"And we think that one means is at
least as good as the <span class="locked">other."<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Now I think that these extracts sufficiently
defend Clausewitz from the imputation
of too great a belief in frontal
attacks, and considering the frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
success of such Napoleonic attacks in his
day, he gives a very fair summing up of
the relative advantages and disadvantages
thereof, and indeed such as might be
written in the present day. Indeed the
quite abnormal conditions of the Boer
war produced such a feeling against
frontal attacks, and so much loose talk
of their being extinct, that it is very
useful to turn to Clausewitz for a reminder
that breaking the centre, whenever
the condition he postulates, namely <em>over-extension
of front</em> on the enemy's part, is
present, will always remain one of the
two great forms of decisive attack open
to a commander.</p>

<p>And as in our day the forces are so
enormous that to reach the hostile flank
becomes more difficult, and the extension
of front becomes so gigantic (a front of
several armies on a line of forty to seventy
miles perhaps), it is well to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
whether breaking the enemy's centre will
not again offer the most advantageous
form for the final decisive act, coupled
of course, as Clausewitz says it <span class="smcap smaller">ALWAYS
MUST</span> be, with a strong flank attack.
And in these gigantic battles of the
future, such as Liao-yang and Mukden,
which we must consider typical of the
future, battles which must take several
days, during which the troops in the first
line become utterly exhausted and used
up,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a decisive attack on the centre can
well be imagined after the hostile reserves
have been decoyed away over a day's
march by a strong flank attack. As, for
example, Nogi's flank attack round Mukden
followed by Nodzu's decisive breaking
the centre and capture of Mukden
itself.</p>

<p>So that far from thinking Clausewitz's
remarks about frontal attacks and breaking
the line to be obsolete, it rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
appears from the great Russo-Japanese
battles that they are worthy of close
study in view of the future.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tactical versus Strategical
Envelopment</span></h3>

<p>A fourth disputed point is the preference
of Clausewitz, owing to his insistence
on the greatest concentration possible
with proper regard for the circumstances,
for the tactical envelopment arranged
on or near the field to strategical envelopment
with divided forces arranged beforehand.
In this matter I will again quote
General v. Caemmerer, who disagrees
with him, and says: "Clausewitz proclaims
the oblique front as the most
effective strategic form of attack, ... that
is to say, when the whole army with
one united front falls upon the strategic
<em>flank</em> of the enemy, and, if victorious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
cuts him from his line of retreat. But
where such a situation cannot be brought
about, where our advance has brought
us before the strategic <em>front</em> of the enemy,
then he sees in the tactical envelopment,
in the formation of an offensive flank,
the proper means of effectively preparing
to push the enemy from his line of retreat,
and he distinctly explains that tactical
envelopment need not at all be the
<em>consequence</em> of strategical envelopment,
and need not at all be prepared long
beforehand by a corresponding advance
of divided forces."</p>

<p>Clausewitz says, "The consequence of
this is that battles fought with enveloping
lines, or even with an oblique front,
which should properly result from an
advantageous relation of the lines of
communication, are commonly the result
of a moral and physical <span class="locked">preponderance."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Also "he should therefore only advance
with his columns on such a width of
front as will admit of their all coming
into action together." "Such separation
into several columns should be made use
of for the disposition of the tactical attack
in the enveloping form" (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> by troops
within a day's march of each other).
"But it must be only of a tactical nature,
for a strategic envelopment, when a great
blow is to be struck, is a complete waste
of power."</p>

<p>General v. Caemmerer comments: "He
is thus of opinion that the lateral movement
of part of the army against the
flank of the enemy could without any
difficulty still be carried out as initiated
by the plan of battle; and in order to
understand this idea we must again bear
in mind the difference between the fire-effect
of then and now. In those days a
comparatively short movement made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
still possible for a considerable portion
of the army to gain the defenders' flank;
to-day a lengthy and troublesome operation
would be necessary for the same
object, and its successful execution would
only be counted upon if the defender
remained entirely passive, and would
neither think of a counter-stroke nor
of a corresponding movement of his
forces to the threatened flank."</p>

<p>Without going into this controversy I
will, however, quote the excellent reason
given by Clausewitz for his preference for
tactical as opposed to strategical envelopment:
"One peculiarity of the offensive
battle is the uncertainty, in most cases,
as to the position (note, and strength)
of the enemy; it is a complete groping
about amongst things that are unknown
(Austerlitz, Wagram, Hohenlinden, Jena,
Katzbach). The more this is the case
the more concentration of forces becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
paramount, and turning a flank to be
preferred to <span class="locked">surrounding."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span></p>

<p>It is also well to recollect how many
famous generals had been ruined in
Clausewitz's experience through over-extension
or dispersion of their forces.
The crushing defeats of Napoleon's marshals
in the winter of 1813, Macdonald
at the Katzbach, Oudinot at Gros Beeren,
Ney at Dennewitz, which neutralized
Napoleon's great victory at Dresden and
began his ruin, were all chiefly owing to
this cause.</p>

<p>And the weather may, again, have as
great influence in shortening resistance
and allowing troops to be overwhelmed
before the too-distant reinforcements
arrive, as it had in those battles. If the
weather then prevented the old muskets
going off, and enabled the attack to rush
the defence, so now a fog, rain, mist, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
snow, by restricting the field of view
and fire, may produce the same results.
When one thinks of the number of great
battles fought in such weather, as they
may well be again, one sees an additional
reason for carefully considering Clausewitz's
warning. Far from relegating his
preference for the tactical as opposed to
the strategical envelopment to the region
of the obsolete, because of our improved
armament, it seems right to give it full
weight as a corrective to a perceivable
tendency to elevate strategical envelopment
(after Königgrätz) into a formula
for victory. If in the past many great
generals have been ruined by over-extension,
so may they be again. Against
this tendency Clausewitz will for ever
lift his voice.</p>

<p>Also it remains to be considered, with
the huge armies of to-day and the future,
such armies as at Liao-yang and Mukden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
such armies as may possibly one day
join issue in Afghanistan, whether strategical
envelopment will be practicable, or
whether tactical envelopment, such as
General Kuroki's tactical enveloping
movement on Yentai, and the Russian
line of retreat at Liao-yang, or General
Nogi's tactical enveloping dash northward
on Hsinminting and the railway
at Mukden, will not be preferable.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as a compromise, one might
call such a movement strategical-tactical,
and so avoid the dispute by jugglery of
words.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to do more than
roughly indicate that the solution of
these four disputed tactical questions in
Clausewitz is to be sought in a study of
the latest campaign, as he would have
said himself; that is, the campaign in
Manchuria. For, as the <i>Times</i> correspondent
in the XLVth Chapter, "Clausewitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
in Manchuria," of his book "The
War in the Far East," observes, "It will
be abundantly clear to any one who
has followed the great battles in Manchuria
that the spirit of Clausewitz has
presided over Japanese victories and wept
over Russian defeats."</p>

<span class="subhead">CHANGES SINCE THE DAYS OF CLAUSEWITZ</span></h2>

<p>In reading Clausewitz it is, first, the
great principles of the nature of war
founded on human nature, which alter
not; and, secondly, it is his spirit and
practical way of looking at things that
we want to assimilate and apply to <span class="smcap smaller">THE
PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY</span>, to which end it
is necessary to read him always with
the changed conditions of to-day in our
minds, and think what he would have
said under the circumstances. These
changes are <span class="locked">chiefly:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>(1) &nbsp; The improved net-work of roads.</li>
<li>(2) &nbsp; Railways.</li>
<li>(3) &nbsp; Telegraphs, wire and wireless.</li>
<li>(4) &nbsp; Improved arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></li>
<li>(5) &nbsp; Aviation</li>
<li>(6) &nbsp; Universal service armies.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Improved Net-work of Roads</span></h3>

<p>The improved net-work of roads in
Europe (not, of course, in Manchuria, or
in Afghanistan where we have to consider
our future strategy, but in Europe),
as General v. Caemmerer puts it, "now
offers to the movements of armies everywhere
a whole series of useful roads
where formerly one or two only were
available," easier gradients, good bridges
instead of unreliable ones, etc. So that
the march-discipline of that day when
concentrated for battle, artillery and train
<em>on</em> the roads, infantry and cavalry <em>by the
side</em> of the roads, has disappeared. Such
close concentration is therefore now not
possible, as we move all arms <em>on</em> the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and an army corps with train, or two
without, is the most that we can now
calculate on bringing into action in one
day on one road.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h3>

<p>"Railways have, above all, completely
altered the term 'base,'" remarks V.
Caemmerer. "Railways carry in a few
days men, horses, vehicles, and materials
of all kinds from the remotest district
to any desired point of our country, and
nobody would any longer think of accumulating
enormous supplies of all kinds
at certain fortified points on his own
frontier with the object of basing himself
on those points. One does not base one's
self any longer on a distinct district
which is specially prepared for that
object, but upon the whole country,
which has become one single magazine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
with separate store-rooms. So the term
'base' has now to be considered in this
light."</p>

<p>It is only when operating in savage
or semi-savage countries, where there
are no railways, that the old idea of a
base applies.</p>

<p>As we penetrate deeper and further
from our own country into the enemy's,
and as a small raiding party can demolish
the railway line so as to stop all traffic
for days or weeks, it becomes far more
necessary than it ever was in Clausewitz's
day to guard our communications. And
armies become more and more sensitive
to any attack upon their communications.</p>

<p>Also "such a line cannot easily be
changed, and consequently those celebrated
changes of the line of communication
in an enemy's country which
Napoleon himself, on some occasion,
declared to be the ablest man&oelig;uvre in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the art of war, could scarcely be carried
out any more" (V. Caemmerer).</p>

<p>Also concentration by means of several
railways demands a broad strategic front,
which produces that separation of corps
or armies which prepares the way for
strategical envelopment, and so on.</p>

<p>General von der Goltz, in his "Conduct
of War," says: "The more recent
treatises on the conduct of war on a
large scale are principally taken up with
the mobilization and strategical concentration
of armies, a department of
strategy which only began to play an
important part in modern times. It is
the result of a dense net-work of railways
in Western Europe which has rendered
it possible to mass large bodies of troops
in a surprisingly brief time. Each Power
tries to outdo its neighbours in this
respect, ... which gives an opportunity
to the strategical specialist to show off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
his brilliant qualities.... Consequently
it is now frequently assumed that the
whole conduct of war is comprised in
this one section of it." This over-estimate
is of course an error, which, however,
requires to be pointed out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Telegraphs</span></h3>

<p>The telegraph has very greatly reduced
the danger of separation. The great
advantage of the inner line in the day
of Napoleon and of Clausewitz was that
separated forces could only communicate
by mounted messengers, so if the enemy
got between them they could not communicate
at all, nor act in concert.
This the telegraph has completely altered,
for as the field telegraph can now be laid
as quickly as an army can advance, the
most widely separated bodies of troops
can every day arrange combined operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
by telegraph through, if necessary,
a point one hundred or four hundred
miles in rear. So that to-day the chief
advantage of the inner line has gone,
while its chief disadvantage, the possibility
of being surrounded, remains.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Maps</span></h3>

<p>We now possess complete detailed Ordnance
maps of every country in Europe,
kept up to date by the latest alterations,
whereas in the days of Clausewitz maps
were of the very roughest character, and
quite unreliable in comparison.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Improved Arms</span></h3>

<p>Smokeless powder, quick-firing and
long-ranging artillery and rifles, the infantry
field of effective fire being ten
times, the artillery five times what it
was in Clausewitz's time, have all to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
borne in mind when reading the tactical
part of his writings. In consequence,
also, cover and the tactical use of ground
are of far greater importance now than
then, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Aviation</span></h3>

<p>The recent wonderful developments in
aviation will obviously almost revolutionize
"Information in War." To what
extent, it is as yet impossible to say.
Each year will teach us more.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Nation-in-Arms</span></h3>

<p>The nation-in-arms as the common
foundation of all armies (except our
own), brought up by railways, vastly
increases the numbers in a modern battle
from what they were in Clausewitz's day.
Compare Austerlitz, Dresden, Leipzig and
Waterloo, with Liao-yang and Mukden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
It should be so with us also, for as
General von der Goltz says in "The
Conduct of War": "The <span class="smcap smaller">BEST</span> military
organization is that which renders available
<span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> the intellectual and material
resources of the country in event of war.
<em>A State is not justified in trying to defend
itself with only a portion of its strength,
when the existence of the whole is at
stake.</em>"</p>

<p>In Great Britain the difference which
the introduction of this nation-in-arms
principle has made in our military strength
compared with that of our future opponents,
a difference relatively <span class="smcap smaller">FAR GREATER
AGAINST US</span> than it was in Napoleon's
and Clausewitz's day, is as yet hardly
realized by the people, or by our statesmen.
People forget the wastage of war,
and the necessity for a constant flow of
troops to repair that wastage. As Von
der Goltz puts it: "It is characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of the strategical offensive that the foremost
body of troops of an army, the
portion which fights the battles, amounts
to only a comparatively small fraction,
frequently only <em>a quarter or even one-eighth</em>,
of the total fighting strength
employed, whilst the fate of the whole
army throughout depends upon the success
or failure of this fraction. <em>Attacking
armies melt away like snow in the spring.</em>"
To condense his remarks: "In spite of
the most admirable discipline, the Prussian
Guard Corps lost 5000 to 6000 men in
the marches between the attack on St.
Privat and the battle of Sedan." "Napoleon
crossed the Niemen in 1812 with
442,000 men, but reached Moscow only
three months later with only 95,000."
In the spring of 1810, the French crossed
the Pyrenees with 400,000 men, but
still Marshal Massena in the end only
brought 45,000 men up to the lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Torres Vedras, near Lisbon, where the
decision lay. Again, in 1829, the Russians
put 160,000 men in the field, but
had barely 20,000 left when, at Adrianople,
a skilfully concluded peace saved
them before their weakness became apparent
and a reaction set in. In 1878 the
Russians led 460,000 across the Danube,
but they only brought 100,000 men&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;of
whom only 43,000 were effective, the
rest being sick&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to the gates of Constantinople.
In 1870 the Germans crossed
the French frontier with 372,000 men,
but after only a six weeks' campaign
brought but 171,000 men to Paris. And
so on. The result of it all is simple&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
a people which is not based on the
modern principle of the nation-in-arms
cannot for long rival or contend with
one that is, for it can neither put an equal
(still less a superior) army into the field
at the outset (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> Clausewitz's first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
principle), nor even maintain in the field
the <em>inferior</em> army it does place there,
because it cannot send the ever-required
fresh supplies of trained troops. Sooner
or later this must tell. Sooner or later a
situation must arise in which the nation
based on the obsolete voluntary system
<em>must</em> go down before a nation based on
the nation-in-arms principle. Circumstances
change with time, and, as wise
Lord Bacon said long ago, "He that will
not adopt new remedies must expect new
evils." May we adopt the remedy before
we experience the evil!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Moral and Spiritual Forces in War</span></h3>

<p>But though these changed conditions
must, of course, <em>modify</em> Clausewitz's
details in many important particulars,
still (to complete our circle and leave off
where we started) I repeat that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
human nature never changes, and as
the moral is to the physical as three to
one in war, Clausewitz, as the great
realistic and practical philosopher on the
actual nature of war, as <em>the chief exponent
of the moral and spiritual forces in war</em>,
will ever remain invaluable in the study
of war.</p>

<p>Consider what unsurpassed opportunities
he had for observing and reflecting
on the influence of enthusiasm and
passion, of resolution and boldness, of
vacillation and weakness, of coolness and
caution, of endurance and hardship, of
patriotism and freedom, of ambition and
of glory&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;on war, either by his own
experience or by conversation with other
equally experienced soldiers, during that
long period of almost endless wars between
1793 and 1815.</p>

<p>The fervour and enthusiasm and boundless
energy of the Revolution, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
drove the French forward, smashing
everything before them, at the beginning;
the ambition, military glory, plunder
and greed, which animated them later
on; the patriotism, religious and loyal
devotion, and stern endurance, which
nerved the Russian hosts then as now;
that awful Moscow winter campaign,
when human nature rose to its highest
and sank to its lowest, when the extremes
of heroic endurance and selfish callousness
were visible side by side; the
magnificent uprising of the spirit of
liberty and freedom from intolerable oppression
in Germany, which gave to the
Prussian recruits and Landwehr the same
driving force that revolutionary enthusiasm
had formerly given to the French;
the passing, therefore, in 1813 of the
moral superiority, the greater driving
force, from the French to the allies.
Clausewitz saw all this; he conversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
intimately with such men as Scharnhorst
and Gneisenau, who saw and guided it,
too. All his friends had seen it also.
No wonder, then, that such an unexampled
series of warlike phenomena
deeply impressed his reflective mind with
the supreme importance of the moral
and spiritual factors in war.</p>

<p>His opportunities for long-continued
observation of warlike phenomena were
far greater than those of any writer
since his day, and it is to be hoped they
will remain so. For we have no desire
to see another series of wars such as the
Napoleonic. It is fortunate for us that
there was then such a man as Clausewitz
to sum up for us so simply and so clearly
the accumulated experiences of those
long, long years of carnage and devastation.</p>
